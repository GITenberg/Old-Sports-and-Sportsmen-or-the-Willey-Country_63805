<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is too much to expect that these
pages will altogether escape criticism; my object will have been
gained, however, if I have succeeded in collecting and placing
intelligibly before the reader such noticeable facts as are
interesting matters of local history.&nbsp; Should it appear that
there has been imported into the work too many details touching
the earlier features of the country, the little that is generally
known on the subject, the close connection of cause and effect,
and the influences the old forests may have had in perpetuating a
love of sport among some members of a family whose name appears
to have been derived from pursuits connected therewith, must be
my excuse.&nbsp; Dr. Arnold once remarked upon the close
connection existing between nature and mankind, and how each in
turn is affected by the other, whilst a living writer, and a
deeper <a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>thinker, has gone still further, in saying that
&ldquo;He is great who is what he is from nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of
course it is not intended to claim greatness for Squire Forester
in the sense in which the word is ordinarily used, or qualities,
even, differing very much from those bearing the impress of the
common mould of humanity; but simply that he was what he was from
nature, from pre-disposition, and from living at the time he
did.&nbsp; Also, that he was in many respects a fair
representative of the squirearchy of the period, of a class of
squires in whom we recognise features discoverable in those in
the enjoyment of the same natural vigour in our own day, but who
may have chosen different fields for its development.</p>
<p>It did not appear to come within the scope of the work to
enter to the same extent upon the doings of other sportsmen of
Squire Forester&rsquo;s time, or to dilate upon those of
gentlemen who subsequently distinguished themselves.&nbsp; It
would have required many additional pages, for instance, to have
done justice to the exploits of the first Lord Forester; or to
those of the present right honourable proprietor of Willey, who
upon retiring from the mastership of the Belvoir hounds was
presented with a massive piece of plate, representing an incident
which happened <a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>in connection with the Hunt.&nbsp; Of both Nimrod has
written in the highest terms.&nbsp; The names of several whose
deeds the same felicitous writer has described in connection with
Shropshire will occur to the reader, as Mr. Stubbs, of Beckbury;
Mr. Childe, of Kinlet; Mr. Boycott, of Rudge&mdash;who succeeded
Sir Bellingham Graham on his giving up the Shifnal country; Lord
Wenlock; Squire Corbett, and the Squire of Halston; names which,
as Colonel Apperley has very justly said, will never be forgotten
by the sporting world.&nbsp; As the reader will perceive, I have
simply acted upon the principle laid down in the &ldquo;Natural
History of Selborne&rdquo; by the Rev. Gilbert White, who says,
&ldquo;If the stationary men would pay some attention to the
district in which they reside, and would publish their thoughts
respecting the objects that surround them, from such materials
might be drawn the most complete county history.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This advice influenced me in undertaking the &ldquo;Severn
Valley,&rdquo; and I have endeavoured to keep the same in view
now, by utilising the materials, and by using the best means at
command for bringing together facts such as may serve to
illustrate them, and which may not be unlooked for in a work of
the kind.</p>
<p><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
viii</span>Since the old Forest Periods, and since old Squire
Forester&rsquo;s day even, the manners and the customs of the
nation have changed; but the old love of sport discoverable in
our ancestors, and inherited more or less by them from theirs,
remains as a link connecting past generations with the
present.</p>
<p>It matters not, it appears to me, whether either the writer or
the reader indulges himself in such sports or not, he may be
equally willing to recall the &ldquo;Olden Time,&rdquo; with its
instances of rough and ready pluck and daring, and to listen to
an old song, made by an aged pate,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of a fine old English gentleman who had a
great estate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shropshire and the surrounding counties during the past
century had, as we all know, many old English gentlemen with
large estates, who kept up their brave old houses at pretty
liberal rates; but few probably exercised the virtue of
hospitality more, or came nearer to the true type of the country
gentleman of the period than the hearty old Willey Squire.&nbsp;
Differ as we may in our views of the chase, we must admit that
such amusements served to relieve the monotony of country life,
and to make time pass pleasantly, which but for horses and
hounds, and the <a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>opportunities they afforded of intercourse with
neighbours, must have hung heavily on a country gentleman&rsquo;s
hands a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>It is, moreover, it appears to me, to this love of sport, in
one form or another, that we of this generation are indebted for
those grand old woods which now delight the eye, and which it
would have been a calamity to have lost.&nbsp; The green
fertility of fields answering with laughing plenty to human
industry is truly pleasing; but now that blue-bells, and violets,
foxgloves and primroses are being driven from the hedgerows, and
these themselves are fast disappearing before the advances of
agricultural science, it is gratifying to think that there are
wastes and wilds where weeds may still resort&mdash;where the
perfumes of flowers, the songs of birds, and the music of the
breeze may be enjoyed.&nbsp; That the love of nature which the
out-door exercises of our ancestors did so much to foster and
perpetuate still survives is evident.&nbsp; How often, for
instance, among dwellers in towns does the weary spirit pant for
the fields, that it may wing its flight with the lark through the
gushing sunshine, and join in the melody that goes pealing
through the fretted cathedral of the woods, whilst caged by the
demands of the hour, or kept <a name="pagex"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. x</span>prisoner by the shop, the counter, or
the machine?&nbsp; Spring, with its regenerating influences, may
wake the clods of the valley into life, may wreathe the black
twigs with their garb of green and white, and give to the trees
their livery; but men who should read the lessons they teach know
nothing of the rejoicings that gladden the glades and make merry
the woods.&nbsp; Nevertheless, proof positive that the love of
nature&mdash;scourged, crushed, and overlaid, it may be, with
anxious cares for existence&mdash;never dies out may be found in
customs still lingering among us.&nbsp; In the blackest iron
districts, where the surface is one great ink-blotch, where
clouds of dust and columns of smoke obscure the day, where scoria
heaps, smouldering fires, and never-ceasing flames give a
scorched aspect to the scene, the quickening influences that
renew creation are felt, teaching men&mdash;ignorant as
Wordsworth&rsquo;s &ldquo;Peter Bell&rdquo;&mdash;to take part in
the festival of the year.&nbsp; When the sap has risen in the
tree when the south wind stirs the young leaves, and the
mechanism of the woods is in motion, when the blackbird has taken
his place in the bush, and the thrush has perched itself upon the
spray, in the month of pelting showers and laughing sunshine,
when the first note of the cuckoo is heard <a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>from the ash
in the hedge-row or the wild cherry in the woods, an old custom
still proclaims a holiday in honour of his arrival.&nbsp; When
the last lingering feature of winter has vanished; when brooks,
no longer hoarse, sink their voices to a tinkling sweetness,
flooding mead and dingle with their music; when the merry, merry
month, although no longer celebrated for its floral shows and
games as formerly, arrives, the May-bush may be seen over the
door of the village smithy and on the heads of horses on the
road.</p>
<p>It would have been of little use passing acts of Parliament,
like the one which has just become law, for the preservation of
members of the feathered tribes, if their native woods had not
been preserved to us by sportsmen.&nbsp; To have lost our woods
would have been to have lost the spring and summer residences of
migratory birds: to have lost the laugh of the woodpecker, the
songs of the blackbird and the thrush, the woodlark&rsquo;s
thrilling melody, and the nightingale&rsquo;s inimitable notes,
to say nothing of those faint soothing shadowings which steal
upon one from these leafy labyrinths of nature.&nbsp; As some one
taking deeper views has said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>&ldquo;There lie around<br />
Thy daily walk great store of beauteous things,<br />
Each in its separate place most fair, and all<br />
Of many parts disposed most skilfully,<br />
Making in combination wonderful<br />
An individual of a higher kind;<br />
And that again in order ranging well<br />
With its own fellows, till thou rise at length<br />
Up to the majesty of this grand world;&mdash;<br />
Hard task, and seldom reached by mortal souls,<br />
For frequent intermission and neglect<br />
Of close communion with the humblest things;<br />
But in rare moments, whether memory<br />
Hold compact with invention, or the door<br />
Of heaven hath been a little pushed aside,<br />
Methinks I can remember, after hours<br />
Of unpremeditated thought in woods.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>A <span class="smcap">simple</span> reading of the history of
the earth is sufficient to show that hunting is as old as the
hills&mdash;not figuratively, but literally; and that the hunter
and the hunted, one furnished with weapons of attack, and the
other with means of defence, have existed from the earliest
periods of creation to the present.&nbsp; That is, the strong
have mastered the weak, and in some instances have fallen side by
side, as we see by their remains.&nbsp; In the economy of <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Nature, the
process of decay appears to have been the exception, rather than
the rule; with beak or tooth, or deadly claw, the strong having
struck down the less defended in a never-ending arena.&nbsp; What
a hunting field, in one sense, the Old World must have been, when
creatures of strange and undefined natures infested the uncertain
limits of the elements, and what encounters must have taken place
in the ooze and mud periods, when monsters, enormous in stature
and stretch of wing, were the implacable hunters of the air, the
water, and the slime!&nbsp; Nor can the inhabitants of the earth,
the water, and the air, taking the term in its broad rather than
in its technical sense, be said to be less hunters now, or less
equipped with deadly weapons.&nbsp; Some have supernumerary teeth
to supply the loss of such as might get broken in the fray.&nbsp;
One strikes down its prey at a blow, another impales its victims
on thorns, and a third slays by poison.&nbsp; Some hunt in
company, from what would seem to be a very love of sport&mdash;as
crows and smaller birds give chase to the owl, apparently
rejoicing in his embarrassment, at break of day.</p>
<p>We need but refer to those remotely removed stages of human
life illustrated by drift beds, bone <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>caves, and shell heaps&mdash;to those
primitive weapons which distinguished the lowest level of the
Stone Age, weapons which every year are being brought to light by
thousands&mdash;to give the <i>genus homo</i> a place among the
hunters; indeed one of the strongest incentives which helped on
Pre-historic Man from one level to the other through the long
night of the darkest ages, appears to have been that which such a
pursuit supplied.&nbsp; To obtain the skins of animals wilder
than himself he entered upon a scramble with the wolf, the bear,
and the hyena.&nbsp; Driven by instinct or necessity to supply
wants the whole creation felt, his utmost ingenuity was put forth
in the chase; and in process of time we find him having recourse
to the inventive arts to enable him to carry out his
designs.&nbsp; On the borders of lakes or on river banks, in
caverns deep-seated amid primeval forest solitudes, he fashioned
harpoons and arrow-heads of shell, horn, or bone, with which to
repulse the attack of prowlers around his retreat and to arrest
the flight of the swiftest beast he required for food; and when
he emerged from the dark night which Science has as yet but
partially penetrated, when he had succeeded in pressing the horse
and the dog into his service, and when the <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>cultivation of
the soil even had removed him above the claims of hunger, he
appears equally to have indulged the passion&mdash;probably for
the gratification it gave and the advantages it brought in
promoting that tide of full health from which is derived the
pleasing consciousness of existence.</p>
<p>Tradition, no less than arch&aelig;ology and the physical
history of the country itself, lead us to suppose that when those
oscillations of level ceased which led to the present
distribution of land and water, one-third of the face of the
country was covered with wood and another with uncultivated moor,
and that marsh lands were extensive.&nbsp; Remains dug up in the
valley of the Severn, and others along the wide stretch of
country drained by its tributaries, together with those
disinterred from the bog and the marsh, show that animals, like
plants, once indigenous, have at comparatively recent periods
become as extinct as Dodos in the Mauritius.&nbsp; Old British
names in various parts of the country, particularly along the
valley of the Severn, exist to show that the beaver once built
its house by the stream, that the badger burrowed in its banks,
and that the eagle and the falcon reared their young on the rocks
above.&nbsp; At the same time, evidence exists <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>to show that
the bear and the boar ranged the forests as late as the conquest
of England by the Normans, whilst the red deer, the egret and the
crane, the bittern and the bustard, remained to a period almost
within living memory.</p>
<p>River loams, river gravels, lake beds, and cave breccias,
disclose hooks and spears, and sometimes fragments of nets, which
show that hunting and fishing were practised by the primitive
dwellers along river plains and valleys.</p>
<p>The situations of abbeys, priories, and other monastic piles,
the ruins of which here and there are seen along the banks of
rivers, and the records the heads of these houses have left
behind them, lead us to suppose that those who reared and those
who occupied them were alive to the advantages the neighbourhood
of good fisheries supplied.&nbsp; Some of the <i>vivaries</i> or
fish-pools, and meres even, which once afforded abundant
supplies, no longer exist, their sites being now green fields;
but indications of their former presence are distinct, whilst the
positions of weirs on the Severn, the rights of which their
owners zealously guarded, may still be pointed out.&nbsp;
Sometimes they were subjects of litigation, as with the canons of
Lilleshall, who claimed <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>rights of fishing in the Severn at
Bridgnorth, and who obtained a bull from Pope Honorius confirming
them in their rights.&nbsp; In 1160 the Abbot of Salop, with the
consent of his chapter, is found granting to Philip Fitz-Stephen
and his heirs the fishery of Sutton (piscarium de Sutana), and
lands near the said fishery.&nbsp; These monks also had fisheries
at Binnal, a few miles from Willey; and it is well known that
they introduced into our rivers several varieties of fish not
previously common thereto, but which now afford sport to the
angler.</p>
<p>Fishing, it is true, may have been followed more as a
remunerative exercise by some members of these religious houses,
still it did not fail to commend itself as an attractive art and
a harmless recreation congenial to a spirit of contemplation and
reflection to many distinguished ecclesiastics.&nbsp; That the
Severn of that day abounded in fish much more than at present is
shown by Bishop Lyttleton, who takes some pains to describe it at
Arley, and who explains the construction of the coracle and its
uses in fishing, the only difference between it both then and
now, and that of early British times, being that the latter was
covered with a horse&rsquo;s hide.</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>A jury,
empannelled for the purpose of estimating the value of Arley
manor upon the death of one of its proprietors, gave the yearly
rental of its fishery at 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>,&mdash;a large sum
in comparison with the value of sixty acres of land, stated to
have been 10<i>s.</i>, or with the rent of a ferry, which was put
down at sixpence.&nbsp; There must have been fine fishing
then.&nbsp; Trout were plentiful, so were salmon; there were no
locks or artificial weirs to obstruct the attempts of
fish&mdash;still true to the instinct of their ancestors&mdash;to
beat the tide in an upward summer excursion in the direction of
its source.&nbsp; The document states that the part of the river
so valued &ldquo;abounded in fish.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="gutindent"><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;The
Bishop of Worcester, by his regulations for the Priory of Little
Malvern, in 1323, enjoins the prior not to fish in the stew set
apart from ancient times <i>for the recreation of the sick</i>,
unless manifest utility, to be approved by the Chapter, should
sanction it; in which case he was, at a fit opportunity, to
replace the fish which he caught.</p>
<p class="gutindent">We fancy it is not difficult to recognise a
growing feeling against that separation of religion, recreation,
and health which unfortunately now exists, and in favour of
re-uniting the three; and we are persuaded that the sooner this
takes place the better for the nation.</p>

</a><span class="smcap">Diversified</span> by wood and moor, by
lake and sedgy pool, dense flocks of wild fowl of various kinds
at one time afforded a profusion of winged game; and the keen eye
and sharp talons of the hawk no doubt pointed it out as a
desirable acquisition to the sportsman long ere he succeeded in
pressing it into his service; indeed it must have been a marked
advance in the art when he first availed himself of its
instinct.&nbsp; Old records supply materials for judging <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>of the
estimation in which this bird was held by our ancestors, it being
not uncommon to find persons holding tenements or paying fines in
lieu of service to the lord of the fee by rendering a <i>sore</i>
sparrow-hawk&mdash;a hawk in its first year&rsquo;s
plumage.&nbsp; Stringent restrictions upon the liberty the old
Roman masters of the country allowed with respect to wild fowl
were imposed; the act of stealing a hawk, and that of taking her
eggs, being punishable by imprisonment for a year and a
day.&nbsp; The highborn, with birds bedecked with hoods of silk,
collars of gold, and bells of even weight, but of different
sound, appeared according to their rank&mdash;a ger-falcon for a
king, a falcon gentle for a prince, a falcon of the rock for a
duke, a janet for a knight, a merlin for a lady, and a lamere for
a squire.&nbsp; From close-pent manor and high-walled castle, to
outspread plain and expansive lake or river <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>bank, the
gentry of the day sought perditch and plover, heron and wild
fowl, many of which the fowling-piece has since driven from their
haunts, and some&mdash;as the bustard and the bittern, the egret
and the crane&mdash;into extinction.</p>
<p>Mention is often made of hawk aeries, as at Little Wenlock,
and in connection with districts within the jurisdiction of
Shropshire forests, which seem to have been jealously
guarded.&nbsp; The use of the birds, too, appears to have been
very much restricted down to the time that the forest-charter,
enabling all freemen to ply their hawks, was wrung from King
John, when a sport which before had been the pride of the rich
became the privilege of the poor.&nbsp; It was at one time so far
a national pastime that an old writer asserts that &ldquo;every
degree had its peculiar hawk, from the emperor down to the
holy-water clerk.&rdquo; <a name="citation10"></a><a
href="#footnote10" class="citation">[10]</a>&nbsp; The sport
seems to have divided itself into field-hawking, pond-hawking,
brook-and-river hawking; into hawking on horseback and hawking on
foot.&nbsp; In foot hawking the sportsman carried a pole, with
which to leap the brook, into which he sometimes fell, as Henry
VIII. did upon his head in the mud, in which he would have been
<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>stifled,
it is said, had not John Moody rescued him; whether this Moody
was an ancestor of the famous Whipper-in or not we cannot
say.</p>
<p>Evidence is not altogether wanting to show that during the
earlier history of the Marsh period, the gigantic elk (<i>Cervus
giganteus</i>), with his wide-spreading antlers, visited, if he
did not inhabit, the flatter portions of the Willey country; and
it is probable that the wild ox equally afforded a mark for the
arrow of the ancient inhabitants of the district in those remote
times, which investigators have distinguished as the
Pile-building, the Stone, and the Bronze periods, when society
was in what has been fittingly called the hunter-state.&nbsp; At
any rate, we know that at later periods the red deer, the goat,
and the boar, together with other &ldquo;beasts,&rdquo; were
hunted, and that both banks of the Severn resounded with the deep
notes of &ldquo;veteran hounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of the two pursuits,
Prior in his day remarks, &ldquo;Hawking comes near to hunting,
the one in the ayre as the other on the earth, a sport as much
affected as the other, by some preferred.&rdquo;&nbsp; That the
chase was the choice pastime of monarchs and nobles before the
Conquest, and the favourite sport of &ldquo;great and worthy
personages&rdquo; after, we learn <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>from old authors, who, like William
Tivici, huntsman to Edward I., have written elaborate descriptive
works, supplying details of the modes pursued, and of the kinds
of dog which were used.</p>
<p>Our Saxon ancestors no doubt brought with them from the great
forests of Germany not only their institutions but the love of
sport of their forefathers, pure and simple.&nbsp; With them the
forests appear to have been open to the people; and, although the
Danes imposed restrictions, King Canute, by his general code of
laws, confirmed to his subjects full right to hunt on their own
lands, providing they abstained from the forests, the pleasures
of which he appears to have had no inclination generally to share
with his subjects.&nbsp; He established in each county four chief
foresters, who were gentlemen or thanes, and these had under them
four yeomen, who had care of the vert and venison; whilst under
these again were two officers of still lower rank, who had charge
of the vert and venison in the night, and who did the more
servile work.&nbsp; King William curtailed many of the old forest
privileges, and limited the sports of the people by prohibiting
the boar and the hare, which Canute had allowed to be taken; and
so jealous was he of the privileges of <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>the chase that he is said to have
ordained the loss of the eyes as the penalty for killing a
stag.&nbsp; His Norman predilections were such that an old
Shropshire historian, Ordericus Vitalis (born at Atcham), who was
at one time chaplain to the Conqueror, charges him with
depopulating whole parishes that he might satisfy his ardour for
hunting.&nbsp; Prince Rufus, who inherited a love of the chase
from his father, is made by a modern author to reply to a warning
given him by saying:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I love the chase, &rsquo;tis mimic war,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the hollow bay of hound;<br />
The heart of the poorest Norman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beats quicker at the sound.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>King John stretched the stringent forest laws of the period to
the utmost, till the love of liberty and of sport together, still
latent among the people, compelled him to submit to an express
declaration of their respective rights.&nbsp; By this declaration
all lands afforested by Henry I. or by Richard were to be
disafforested, excepting demesne woods of the crown; and a fine
or imprisonment for a year and a day, in case of default, was to
be substituted for loss of life and members.</p>
<p>To prevent disputes with regard to the king&rsquo;s <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>forests, it
was also agreed that their limits should be defined by
perambulations; but as a check upon the boldness of offenders in
forests and chaces, and warrens, and upon the disposition of
juries to find against those who were appointed to keep such
places, it was deemed necessary on the other hand to give
protection to the keepers.</p>
<p>Large sums were lavished by kings and nobles on the kennels
and appliances necessary for their diversions.&nbsp; Nor were
these costly establishments confined to the laity.&nbsp; Bishops,
abbots, and high dignitaries of the Church, could match their
hounds and hawks against those of the nobles, and they equally
prided themselves upon their skill in woodcraft.</p>
<p>That the clergy were as much in favour of these amusements as
the laity, appears from an old Shropshire author, Piers Plowman
(Langland), who satirically gave it as his opinion that they
thought more of sport than of their flocks, excepting at shearing
time; and likewise from Chaucer, who says, &ldquo;in hunting and
riding they are more skilled than in divinity.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
Richard de Castillon, an early rector of Madeley, was a sportsman
appears from the fact that when Henry III. was in Shrewsbury in
September, 1267, concluding a treaty with Llewellyn, and settling
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>sundry
little differences with the monks and burgesses there, he granted
him license to hunt &ldquo;in the royal forest of Madeley,&rdquo;
then a portion of that of the Wrekin.&nbsp; In 1283 also, King
Edward permitted the Prior of Wenlock to have a park at Madeley,
to fence out a portion of the forest, and to form a haia there
for his deer.&nbsp; It has been said that Walter, Bishop of
Rochester, was so fond of sport, that at the age of fourscore he
made hunting his sole employment.&nbsp; The Archdeacon of
Richmond, at his initiation to the Priory of Bridlington, is
reported to have been attended by ninety-seven horses, twenty-one
dogs, and three hawks.&nbsp; Walter de Suffield, Bishop of
Norwich, bequeathed by will his pack of hounds to the king; but
the Abbot of Tavistock, who had also a pack, was commanded by his
bishop about the same time to break it up.&nbsp; A famous hunter
was the Abbot of Leicester, whose skill in the sport of hare
hunting was so great, that we are told the king himself, his son
Edward, and certain noblemen, paid him an annual pension that
they might hunt with him.&nbsp; Bishop Latimer said: &ldquo;In my
time my poor father was as diligent to teach me to shoot as to
learn me any other thing, and so I think other men did their
children.&nbsp; He taught <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>me how to draw, how to lay my body in
my bow, and not draw with strength of arms as other nations
do;&rdquo; and the good bishop exclaims with the enthusiasm of a
patriot, &ldquo;It is a gift of God that He hath given us to
excel all other nations withal; it hath been God&rsquo;s
instrument whereby He hath given us many victories over our
enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were the &ldquo;merrie days,&rdquo; when the kennels of
the country gentry contained all sorts of dogs, and their halls
all sorts of skins, when the otter and the badger were not
uncommon along the banks of Shropshire streams, and ere the fox
had taken first rank on the sportsman&rsquo;s list.&nbsp; An old
&ldquo;Treatise on the Craft of Hunting&rdquo; first gives the
hare, the herte, the wulf, and the wild boar.&nbsp; The author
then goes on to say&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But there ben other beastes five of the
chase;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The buck the first, the second is the doe,<br />
The fox the third, which hath ever hard grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth the martyn, and the last the
roe.&rdquo;</p>

name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Ordericus
Vitalis.&nbsp; In some instances they were the growth of wide
areas offering favourable conditions of soil for the production
of timber, as in the case of that of Morfe.&nbsp; In others they
were the result probably of the existence of hilly districts so
sterile as to offer few inducements to cultivate them, as in the
case of Shirlot, the Stiperstones, the Wrekin, and of the Clee
Hills.&nbsp; Some of these have histories running side by side
with that of the nation, and associations closely linked with the
names of heroic men and famous sportsmen.&nbsp; Morfe Forest,
which was separated from that of Shirlot by the Severn, along
which it ran a considerable distance in the direction of its
tributary the Worf, is rich in traditions of the rarest kind, the
Briton, the Roman, Saxon, Dane, and Norman, having in succession
left mementoes of their presence.&nbsp; Here, as Mr. Eyton in his
invaluable work on the &ldquo;Antiquities of Shropshire&rdquo;
says,&mdash;&ldquo;Patriotism, civilisation, military science,
patient industry, adventurous barbarism, superstition, chivalry,
and religion have each played a part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ancient British tumuli examined and described more than
one hundred and thirty years ago by the Rev. Mr. Stackhouse have
been levelled by the plough, but &ldquo;the Walls&rdquo; at
Chesterton, and the <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>evidence the name of Stratford supplies as to Roman
occupation, to which Mr. Eyton refers, as well as the rude
fortifications of Burf Castle, constructed by the Danes when they
came to recruit after being out-man&oelig;uvred by Alfred on the
Thames, remain.&nbsp; At Quatford, a mile and a half west, on
three sides of a rock overhanging the Severn, near to Danesford,
are trenches cut out of the solid sandstone which, whether Danish
or Norman, or in part both, shewed by the vast number of wild
boar and red deer remains disclosed a few years ago the success
with which the chase had here at one time been pursued.</p>
<p>Within the forest were four manors, the continuous estate in
Saxon times of Algar, Earl of Mercia, which after the Conquest
were granted in their integrity to the first Norman Earl of
Shrewsbury, and which in 1086 were held wholly in demesne by his
son Hugh.&nbsp; The predilections of the first Norman Earl of
Shrewsbury for this vast forest, lying between those of Kinver,
Wyre, and Shirlot,&mdash;the whole of which wide wooded district
seems to have been comprehended under the old British name of
<i>Coed</i>&mdash;are shown by the fact that he built his
famous&rsquo; castle on the Severn close by, and founded <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>there his
collegiate church, the stones of which remain to attest its
erection by a Norman founder.&nbsp; The legend relating to the
erection of the church seems so well to bear out the supposition
that Morfe was the favourite hunting ground of the earl that,
although frequently quoted, it may not be out of place to give
it.&nbsp; In substance it is this:&mdash;</p>
<p>In 1082, Sir Roger married for his second wife a daughter of
Sir Ebrard de Pusey, one of the chief nobles of France.&nbsp; On
coming over to England to join her husband a storm arose which
threatened the destruction of the vessel when, wearied with much
watching, a priest who accompanied her fell asleep and had a
vision, in which it was said:&mdash;&ldquo;If thy lady would wish
to save herself and her attendants from the present danger of the
sea, let her make a vow to God and faithfully promise to build a
church in honour of the blessed Mary Magdalene, on the spot where
she may first happen to meet her husband in England, especially
where groweth a hollow oak, and where the wild swine have
shelter.&rdquo;&nbsp; The legend adds that upon awaking the
priest informed his lady, who took the prescribed vow; that the
storm ceased, that the ship arrived safely in port, that the lady
met the earl hunting the boar where <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>an old hollow oak stood, and that at
her request, and in fulfilment of her vow, Sir Roger built and
endowed the church at Quatford, which a few years ago only was
taken down and rebuilt.</p>

</a></p>
<p>On the high ground a little above the church there are still
several trees whose gnarled and knotted trunks have borne the
brunt of many centuries, two of which are supposed to have sprung
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>from the
remains of the one mentioned in the legend.</p>
<p>Not only legends, but traditions, and some historical
incidents, as those brought to light by the Forest Rolls, afford
now and then an insight of the sporting kind of life led within
the boundary and jurisdiction of the forest and upon its
outskirts.&nbsp; The bow being not only the chief weapon of sport
but of war, those with a greater revenue from land than one
hundred pence were at one time not only permitted but compelled
to have in their possession bows and arrows, but, to prevent
those living within the precincts of the forest killing the
king&rsquo;s deer, the arrows were to be rounded.&nbsp; These
were sometimes sharpened, and disputes arose between their
owners, the dwellers in the villages, and the overseers of the
forest, the more fruitful source of grievance being with the
commoners, who, claiming pasturage for their cows and their
horses, often became poachers.&nbsp; On one occasion a kid being
wounded by an arrow at Atterley, on the Willey side of the
Severn, and the culprit not being forthcoming, a whole district
is in <i>misericordi&acirc;</i>, under the ban of the fierce
Forest Laws of the period.&nbsp; On another occasion a stag
enters the postern gate of the Castle of Bridgnorth, and the
vision of venison <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>within reach proving too strong for the Castellan, he is
entrapped, and litigation ensues.&nbsp; Sometimes the stout
foresters and sturdy guardians of the castle, and burgesses of
the town, indulge in friendly trials of skill at quarter-staff or
archery, or in a wrestling match for a cross-bow, a ram, or a
&ldquo;red gold ring.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Ritson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Robin
Hood&rdquo; we read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By a bridge was a wrastling,<br />
And there taryed was he:<br />
And there was all the best yemen<br />
Of all the west countrey.<br />
A full fayre game there was set up,<br />
A white bull up y-pight,<br />
A great courser with saddle and brydle<br />
With gold burnished full bryght;<br />
A payre of gloves, a red golde ringe,<br />
A pipe of wyne good fay:<br />
What man bereth him best I wis,<br />
The prize shall bear away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1292, a wrestling match at a festive gathering on
Bernard&rsquo;s Hill takes place, when from ill blood arising
from an old feud a dispute ensues, and a forester named Simon de
Leyre quarrels with Robert de Turbevill, a canon of St.
Mary&rsquo;s, Bridgnorth, over a greyhound, which the latter,
contrary to the regulations of the courts, had brought within the
forest; and a jury of foresters, verderers, and regarders, <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>in pursuance
of the king&rsquo;s writ, is empowered to try the case.&nbsp; The
evidence adduced shows that the foresters were to blame, the
verdict come to being that the men of Brug, although at the
wrestling match with bows and arrows, were in no way chargeable
with the assault upon the forester.&nbsp; &ldquo;They had been
indicted for trespass,&rdquo; the jurors said, &ldquo;not under
any inquest taken on the matter, but by one Corbett&rsquo;s
suggestion to the Justice of the Forest; they had been attacked
and imprisoned under the warrant of the said Justice,
Corbett&rsquo;s grudge being that two men of Brug had once
promised him a cask of wine, a present in which the corporate
body refused to join.&rdquo;&nbsp; Corbett was pronounced by the
jurors &ldquo;a malevolent and a procurer of evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To correct evils like these the &ldquo;ordinatio&rdquo; of
Edward I. was introduced, containing many beneficial regulations,
and stating that proceedings had been taken in the forest by one
or two foresters or verderers to extort money, also providing
that all trespassers in the forest of green hue and of hunting
shall be presented by the foresters at the next Swainmote before
foresters, verderers, and other officers.&nbsp; In the same year
the king <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>confirmed the great charter of liberties of the
forest.</p>
<p>Various official reports of this Chace, drawn up from time to
time, show how the great forest of Morfe gradually diminished, as
the vills of Worfield and Claverley, and other settlements,
extended within its limits, causing waste and destruction at
various times of timber.&nbsp; During the Barons&rsquo; War the
bosc of Claverley was further damaged, it was said, &ldquo;by
many goats frequenting the cover;&rdquo; it suffered also from
waste by the Earl of Chester, who sold from it 1,700 oak
trees.&nbsp; Other wastes are recorded, as those caused by
cutting down timber &ldquo;for the Castle of Bridgnorth,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;for enclosing the vill before it was fortified by a
wall.&rdquo;&nbsp; The report further states that &ldquo;there
were few beasts,&rdquo; because &ldquo;they were destroyed in the
time of war, and in the time when the liberty of the forest was
conceded.&rdquo;&nbsp; By degrees, from one cause or another, and
by one means or another, this, the &ldquo;favourite chace of
English kings and Norman earls,&rdquo; which, so late as 1808,
consisted of upwards of 3,820 acres, disappeared, leaving about
the names of places it once enclosed an air of quaint antiquity,
the very mention of some of which may be interesting.&nbsp; <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Among them
are Bowman&rsquo;s Hill, Bowman&rsquo;s Pit, and Warrener&rsquo;s
Dead Fall&mdash;names carrying back the mind to times when bowmen
were the reliance of English leaders in battles fought on the
borders, and before strongholds like the Castle of
Bridgnorth.&nbsp; Gatacre, and Gatacre Hall, suggest a passing
notice of a family which witnessed many such encounters, and
which remained associated with a manor here from the reign of
Edward the Confessor to the time when Earl Derby sought shelter
as a fugitive after the Battle of Worcester.&nbsp; As Camden
describes it, the old hall must have been a fitting residence
truly for a steward of the forest.&nbsp; It had, in the middle of
each side and centre, immense oak trees, hewn nearly square, set
with their heads on large stones, and their roots uppermost, from
which a few rafters formed a complete arched roof.</p>
<p>The Hermitage, with its caves hewn out of the solid sand rock,
by the road which led through the forest in the direction of
Worfield, meets us with the tradition that here the brother of
King Athelstan came seeking retirement from the world, and ended
his days within sight of the queenly Severn.&nbsp; Besides
tradition, however, evidence exists to shew that this <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>eremetical
cave, of Saxon origin, under the patronage of the crown, was
occupied by successive hermits, each being ushered to the cell
with royal seal and patent, in the same way as a dean, constable,
or sheriff was introduced to his office; as in the case of John
Oxindon (Edward III., 1328), Andrew Corbrigg (Edward III., 1333),
Edmund de la Marc (Edward III., 1335), and Roger Boughton (Edward
III., 1346).&nbsp; From the frequency of the presentations, it
would appear either that these hermits must have been near the
termination of their pilgrimage when they were inducted, or that
confinement to a damp cell did not agree with them: indeed, no
one looking at the place itself would consider it was a desirable
one to live in.</p>
<p>Other names not less significant of the former features of the
country occur, as Stoneydale, Copy Foot, Sandy Burrow, Quatford
Wyches, and Hill House Flat,&mdash;where the remains of an old
forest oak may still be seen.&nbsp; In addition to these we find
Briery Hurst, Rushmoor Hill, Spring Valley, Stanmore Grove, and
Essex Fall, the latter being at the head of a ravine, half
concealed by wood, where tradition alleges the Earl of Essex,
grandson of the Earl who founded St. James&rsquo;s, a refuge, a
little <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>lower down, for sick and suffering pilgrims, which had
unusual forest privileges allowed by royal owners, was killed
whilst hunting.&nbsp; Here too, higher up on the hill, may still
be seen the remains of the old Forest Lodge, which, with its
picturesque scenes, must have been associated with the visits of
many a noble steward and forest-ranger.&nbsp; Many a hunter of
the stag and wild boar has on the walls of this old Lodge hung up
his horn and spear, as he sought rest and refreshment for the
night.</p>
<p>The names of some of the stewards and other officers of the
forest are preserved, together with their tenures and other
privileges.&nbsp; By an inquisition in the reign of Henry III.,
it was found that Robert, son of Nicholas, and others were seized
of &ldquo;Morffe Bosc.&rdquo; <a name="citation28"></a><a
href="#footnote28" class="citation">[28]</a>&nbsp; In the 13 Hen.
IV., &ldquo;Worfield had common of pasture in
Morffe.&rdquo;&nbsp; Besides many tenures (enumerated in
Duke&rsquo;s &ldquo;Antiquities of Shropshire,&rdquo; p. 52),
dependent upon the forest, the kings (when these tenures were
grown useless and obsolete) appointed stewards and rangers to
take care of the woods and the deer; in the 19 Rich. II., Richard
Chelmswick was forester for life: in the 1 Henry IV., John Bruyn
was forester; and in <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>the 26th Henry IV., the stewardships
of the forest of Morfe and Shirlot were granted to John Hampton,
Esq., and his heirs.&nbsp; Again, we find 9 Henry VII., rot. 28,
George Earl of Shrewsbury, was steward and ranger for life, with
a fee of 4<i>d.</i> per day.&nbsp; Orig. 6 Edward VI., William
Gatacre de Gatacre, in com. Salop, had a lease of twenty-one
years of the stewardship; and in the 20th Elizabeth, George
Bromley had a lease of twenty-one years of the stewardship, at a
rent of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, et de incremento, 12<i>d.</i>; and
36 Elizabeth, George Powle, Gent., was steward, with a fee of
4<i>d.</i> per day.</p>
<p>One of the descendants of George Earl of Shrewsbury sold at no
very distant period the old Lodge and some land to the Stokes
family of Roughton, and the property is still in their
possession.&nbsp; The remains of the old Lodge were then more
extensive, but they were afterwards pulled down, with the
exception of that portion which still goes by the name.&nbsp; As
we have said, these places have about them interesting forest
associations, reminding us that early sportsmen here met to enjoy
the pleasures of the chase, with a success sometimes told by
red-deer bones and wild-boar tusks, dug from some old ditch or
trench.&nbsp; Where the plough-share now <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>cleaves the
sandy soil, the wild-boar roamed at will; where fat kine feed in
pastures green, stout oaks grew, and red-deer leaped; where the
Albrighton red-coats with yelping hounds now meet, the ringing
laugh of lords and ladies, of bishops and their clergy, hunting
higher game, was heard.&nbsp; Then, as good old Scott has
said,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the lofty arched hall<br />
Was spread the gorgeous festival,<br />
Then rose the riot and the din<br />
Above, beneath, without, within,<br />
For from its lofty balcony,<br />
Rang trumpet, shawm and psaltery.<br />
Their clanging bowls old warriors quaff&rsquo;d,<br />
Loudly they spoke and loudly laugh&rsquo;d,<br />
Whisper&rsquo;d young knights in tones more mild,<br />
To ladies fair, and ladies smiled.<br />
The hooded hawks, high perch&rsquo;d on beam,<br />
The clamour join&rsquo;d with whistling scream,<br />
And flapped their wings and shook their bells,<br />
In concert with the stag-hounds&rsquo; yells.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Eyton</span> thinks the afforestation
of Shirlot was probably suggested by its proximity to the
Morville and Chetton manors, where Saxon kings and Mercian earls
had their respective demesnes, and that Henry I. and his
successors, in visiting the Castle of Bridgnorth, or as guests of
the Prior of Wenlock, had <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>obvious reasons for perpetuating
there the exclusive rights of a Royal chace.&nbsp; Although
Shirlot Forest was separated from that of Morfe by the Severn,
its jurisdiction extended across the river to Apley, and embraced
places lying along the right bank of the river, in the direction
of Cressage.&nbsp; Bridgnorth with its surroundings was not taken
out of its jurisdiction or thrown open by perambulation till
1301, when it was disafforested, together with Eardington, Much
Wenlock, Broseley, and other places.&nbsp; The extent and ancient
jurisdiction of this forest may be estimated by the number of
places taken from it at this date, as Benthall, Buildwas, Barrow,
Belswardine, Shineton, Posenall, Walton, Willey, Atterley, the
Dean, the Bold, Linley, Caughley, Little Caughley, Rowton,
Sweyney, Appeleye (the only vill eastward of Severn), Colemore,
Stanley, Rucroft, Medewegrene, Cantreyne, Simon de Severn&rsquo;s

Aldenham, the Bosc of the Earl of Arundel within the bounds of

</a></p>
<p>The ancient extent of the forest must have been about twelve
miles by five.&nbsp; The names of the places mentioned to which
the limits of the chace are traced are so different in many
instances from the present that it may be of interest to give a
few of them.&nbsp; From Yapenacres Merwey the boundary was to go
up to the Raveneshok (Ravens&rsquo; Oak), thence straight to the
Brenallegrene, near the Coleherth (Coal Hearth) going up by the
Fendeshok (Friends&rsquo; Oak) to the Dernewhite-ford.&nbsp;
Thence upwards to the Nethercoumbesheved; and so straight through
the Middlecoumbesheved, and then down to Caldewall.&nbsp; Then
down through the Lynde to the Mer Elyn.&nbsp; Thence down to
Dubledaneslegh, <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>and then up by a certain watercourse to the Pirle; and
so up to Wichardesok; and so to the Pundefold; and so down by the
Shepewey to the Holeweeuen, and then up by a certain fence to
Adame&rsquo;s Hale (Adam&rsquo;s Hall), and thus by the assarts
which John de Haldenham (Aldenham) holds at a rent of the king to
the corner of Mokeleyes Rowe (Muckley Row); and thence down to
Yapenacres Merwey, where the first land-mark of the Haye
begins.&nbsp; There was also, it was said, a certain bosc which
the King still held in the same forest, called Benthlegh Haye
(Bentley Haye).</p>
<p>In addition to this Haye there was the Haye of Shirlot,
opposite to which a portion of the forest in the fifth of Henry
III.&rsquo;s reign was ordered to be assarted, which consisted in
grubbing up the roots so as to render the ground fit for
tillage.</p>
<p>In connection with these Hayes, generally a staff of
foresters, verderers, rangers, stewards, and regarders was kept
up; and forest courts were also held at stated times (in the
forest of the Clee every six weeks), at which questions and
privileges connected with the forest were considered.&nbsp;
Philip de Baggesour, Forester of the Fee in the king&rsquo;s free
Haye of Schyrlet in 1255, in the Inquisition of <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Hundreds, is
said to have under him &ldquo;two foresters, who give him
20<i>s.</i> per annum for holding their office, and to make a
levy on oats in Lent, and on wheat in autumn.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The aforesaid Philip,&rdquo; it is said, &ldquo;hath now
in the said Haye of Windfalls as much as seven trees, and
likewise all trees which are wind-fallen, the jurors know not by
what warrant except by ancient tenure.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
privileged officers had good pickings, evidently by means of
their various time-sanctioned customs, and jolly lives no doubt
they led.</p>
<p>In the forty-second of Henry III. Hammond le Strange was
steward of this forest, and in the second of Edward I. the
king&rsquo;s forester is said to have given the sheriff of the
county notice that he was to convey all the venison killed in the
forests of Salop, and deliver it at Westminster to the
king&rsquo;s larder, for the use of the king&rsquo;s
palace.&nbsp; According to the same record, the profits that were
made of the oaks that were fallen were to be applied to the
building of a vessel for the king.&nbsp; In the nineteenth of
Richard II., Richard Chelmswick was appointed forester for life;
and in the twenty-sixth of Henry III. the stewardship both of the
forests of Morfe and of Shirlot was granted to John Hampton and
his heirs.</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Some of
the chief foresters also held Willey, and probably resided there;
at any rate it is not improbable that a building which bears
marks of extreme antiquity, between Barrow and Broseley, called
the Lodge Farm, was once the hunting lodge.&nbsp; It has
underneath strongly arched and extensive cellaring, which seems
to be older than portions of the superstructure, and which may
have held the essentials for feasts, for which sportsmen of all
times have been famous.&nbsp; Near the lodge, too, is the
<i>Dear-Loape</i>, or Deer Leap, a little valley through which
once evidently ran a considerable stream, <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>and near
which the soil is still black, wet, and boggy.&nbsp; A deer leap,
dear loape, or <i>saltory</i>, was a pitfall&mdash;a contrivance
common during the forest periods, generally at the edge of the
chace, for taking deer, and often granted by charter as a
privilege&mdash;as that, for instance, on the edge of Cank, or
Cannock Chace.&nbsp; Sometimes these pitfalls, dug for the
purpose of taking game, were used by poachers, who drove the deer
into them.&nbsp; It is, therefore, easy to understand why the
forest lodge should be near, as a protection.&nbsp; It was
usually one of the articles of inquiry at the Swainmote Court
whether &ldquo;any man have any great close within three miles of
the forest that have any saltories, or great gaps called deer
loapes, to receive deer into them when they be in chasing, and
when they are in them they cannot get out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Among sportsmen of these forest periods we must not omit to
notice the Priors of the ancient Abbey of Wenlock.&nbsp; The
heads of such wealthy establishments by no means confined
themselves within the limits of the chapter-house.&nbsp; They
were no mere cloistered monks, devoted to book and candle, but
jolly livers, gaily dressed, and waited upon by well-appointed
servants; like the Abbot of Buildwas, who <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>had for his
vassal the Lord of Buildwas Parva, who held land under him on
condition that he and his wife should place the first dish on the
abbot&rsquo;s table on Christmas Day, and ride with him any
whither within the four seas at the abbot&rsquo;s charge.&nbsp;
They had huntsmen and hounds, and one can imagine their sporting
visitation rounds among their churches, the chanting of priests,
the deep-mouthed baying of <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>dogs, early matins, and the
huntsman&rsquo;s bugle horn harmoniously blending in the
neighbourhood of the forest.&nbsp; Hugh Montgomery in his day
gave to the abbey a tithe of the venison which he took in its
woods, and in 1190 we find the Prior of Wenlock giving twenty
merks to the king that he may &ldquo;have the Wood of Shirlott to
himself, exempt from view of foresters, and taken out of the
Regard.&rdquo;&nbsp; As we have already shown, the priors had a
park at Madeley, they had one at Oxenbold, and they also had
privileges over woods adjoining the forest of the Clees, where
the Cliffords exercised rights ordinarily belonging to royal
proprietors, and where their foresters carried things with such a
high hand, and so frequently got into trouble with those of the
priors, that the latter were glad to accept an arrangement, come
to after much litigation in 1232, by which they were to have a
tenth beast only of those taken in their own woods at Stoke and
Ditton, and of those started in their demesne boscs, and taken
elsewhere.&nbsp; These boscs appear to have been woodland patches
connecting the long line of forest stretching along the flanks of
the Clee Hills with that on the high ground of Shirlot and, as in
the case of others even much further removed, their <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>ownership was
exceedingly limited.&nbsp; One of the complaints against
Clifford&rsquo;s foresters was, that they would not suffer the
priors&rsquo; men to keep at Ditton Priors and Stoke St. Milburgh
any dogs not <i>expedited</i>, or mutilated in their feet, nor
pasture for their goats.</p>

<p>Imbert, one of these priors, was chosen as one of the
Commissioners for concluding a truce with David ap Llewellyn in
July, 1244.&nbsp; He was subsequently heavily fined for
trespasses for assarting, or grubbing up the roots of trees, in
forest lands at Willey, Broseley, Coalbrookdale, Madeley, and

<p>A survey of the Haye of Shirlot, made by four knights of the
county, pursuant to a royal writ in October 21, 1235, sets forth
&ldquo;its custody good as regards oak trees and underwood,
except that great deliveries have been made by order of the king
to the Abbeys of Salop and Bildewas, to the Priory of Wenlock,
and to the Castle of Brug, for the repairs of buildings,
&amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some curious tenures existed within the jurisdiction of this
forest, one of which it may be worth while deviating from our
present purpose to notice, <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>as it affords an insight into the
early iron manufacturing operations which, at a later period, led
to the destruction of forest trees, but, at the same time, to the
development of the mineral wealth of the district within and
bordering upon the forest.&nbsp; Of its origin nothing is known;
but it is supposed to have arisen out of some kingly peril or
other forest incident connected with the chase.&nbsp; It
consisted in this, that the tenant of the king at the More held
his land upon the condition that he appeared yearly in the
Exchequer with a hazel rod of a year&rsquo;s growth and a
cubit&rsquo;s length, and two knives.&nbsp; The treasurer and
barons being present, the tenant was to attempt to sever the rod
with one of the knives, so that it bent or broke.&nbsp; The other
knife was to do the same work at one stroke, and to be given up
to the king&rsquo;s chamberlain for royal use. <a
name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a></p>
<p>That iron was manufactured at a very early period in the heart
of the forests of Shirlot and the Clees, is shown by Leland, who
informs us that in his day there were blow-shops upon the Brown
Clee Hills in Shropshire, where iron ores were exposed upon the
hill sides, and where, from the fact that <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>wood was
required for smelting, it is only reasonable to look for
them.&nbsp; Historical records and monastic writings, as well as
old tenures, traditions, and heaps of slag, tell us that iron had
been manufactured in the midst of these woods from very remote
periods.&nbsp; As far back as 1250, a notice occurs of a right of
road granted by Philip de Benthall, Lord of Benthall, to the
monks of Buildwas, over all his estate, for the carriage of
stone, coal, and timber; and in an old work in the Deer Leap,
very primitive wooden shovels, and wheels flanged and cut out of
the solid block, and apparently designed to bear heavy weights,
were found a short time since, which are now in possession of Mr.
Thursfield, of Barrow, together with an iron axletree and some
brass sockets, two of which have on them &ldquo;P. B.,&rdquo;
being the initials of Philip Benthall, or Philip Burnel, it is
supposed, the latter having succeeded the former.&nbsp; At
Linley, and the Smithies, traces of old forges occur; so that
there is good reason for supposing that knives and other articles
of iron may have been manufactured in the district from a very
early period.&nbsp; Among the assets, for instance, of the Priory
of Wenlock, in the year 1541&ndash;2, is a mine of ironstone, at
Shirlot, fermed for <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>&pound;2 6<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> per annum; and a forge,
described as an Ierne Smythee, or a smith&rsquo;s place, in
Shirlot, rented at &pound;12 8<i>s.</i>&nbsp; Another forge
produced &pound;2 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per annum; and the
produce of some other mineral, probably coal, was &pound;5
3<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>&nbsp; These large rents for those days
show the advance made in turning to account the mineral wealth of
the district, and the superior value of mines compared with
trees, or mere surface produce.</p>
<p>Wherever powerful streams came down precipitous channels,
little forges with clanging hammers were heard reverberating
through the woods as early as the reigns of the Tudors.&nbsp;
Their sites now are&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Downy banks damask&rsquo;d with
flowers:&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but they reveal the havoc made of the timber by cutting and
burning it for charcoal down to the reign of Elizabeth, when an
act was passed to restrict the use for such purposes.</p>
<p>These iron-making and mining operations caused the forest to
be intersected by roads and tramways, as old maps and reports of
the forest shew us; so that few beasts, except those passing
between their more secluded haunts, were to be found there; and,
<a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>as the
stragglers preferred the tender vegetation the garden of the
cottager afforded, even these were sometimes noosed, or shot with
bows and arrows, which made no noise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>To such an extent had destruction of timber in this and other
forests in the country been carried, that it was feared that in
the event of a foreign war sufficient timber could not be found
for the use of the navy.&nbsp; A reaction, however, set in:
wealthy <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>landowners set themselves to work to remedy the evil by
planting and preserving trees, especially the oak; and many of
the woods and plantations which gladden the eye of the traveller
in passing through the country, and which afford good sport to
the Wheatland and Albrighton packs, were the result.</p>
<p>To this indigenous and deep-rooted love of sport we are
therefore indebted, to a very great extent, for those beautiful
woods which adorn the Willey country and many other portions of
the kingdom.&nbsp; But for our woods and the &ldquo;creeping
things&rdquo; they shelter, we should have imperfect conceptions
of those earlier phases of the island:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When stalked the bison from his shaggy
lair,<br />
Thousands of years before the silent air<br />
Was pierced by whizzing shafts of hunters keen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The country would have been wanting in subjects such as
Creswick, with faithful expressions of foliage and knowledge of
the play of light and shade, has depicted.&nbsp; It would have
lost the text-work of those characteristics Constable revelled
in, and those Harding gave us in his oaks.&nbsp; We should have
lost subjects for the poet as well as for the painter; for the
ballad literature of the country is redolent of sights and sounds
associated therewith.&nbsp; <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>To come down from the earliest
times.&nbsp; How the old Druids reverenced them! how the
compilers of that surprising survey of the country we find in
Domesday noted all details concerning them! what joyous allusions
Chaucer, Spenser, and later writers make to them! what peculiar
charms the &ldquo;merry green-wood&rdquo; and the deep forest
glades had for the imagination of the people!&nbsp; Hence the
popular sympathy expressed by means of tales and traditions <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>in connection
with Sherwood&rsquo;s sylvan shade, and the many editions of the
song of the bold outlaw, and of the adventures contained
therein.&nbsp; Even the utilitarian philosopher and the ultra
radical, fleeing from the stifling atmosphere of the town, and
diving for an hour or so into some paternal wood, is inclined, we
fancy, to sponge from his memory the bitter things he has said of
the owners and of that aristocratic class who usually value and
guard them as they do their picture galleries.&nbsp; Thanks to
such as these, there is now scarcely a run in the Willey country
but brings the sportsman face to face with vestiges of some
sylvan memorial Nature or man has planted along the hill and
valley sides, memorials renewed again and again, as winter after
winter rends the red leaves from the trees: and the man who has
not made a pilgrimage, for sport or otherwise, through these
far-reaching sylvan slopes along the valley of the Severn,
stretching almost uninterruptedly for seven or eight miles, or
through some similar wooded tract, witnessing the sheltered
inequalities of the surface, varied by rocky glens and rushy
pools&mdash;the winter haunt of snipe and woodcock&mdash;has
missed much that might afford him the highest interest.&nbsp; <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>Here and
there, on indurated soils along the valley sides, opportunities
occur of studying the manner in which trees of several
centuries&rsquo; growth send their gnarled and massive roots in
between the rocks in search of nourishment, for firmness, or to
resist storms that shake branches little inferior to the parent
stem.&nbsp; Few places probably have finer old hollies and
yew-trees indigenous to the soil, relieving the monotony of the
general grey by their sombre green&mdash;trees rooted where they
grew six or eight centuries since, and carrying back the mind to
the time of Harold and the bowmen days of Robin Hood.</p>

<p>Spoonhill, a very well-known covert of the Wheatland Hunt, was
a slip of woodland as early as a perambulation in 1356, when it
was recorded to lie outside the forest, its boundary on the
Shirlot side being marked by a famous oak called Kinsok,
&ldquo;which stood on the king&rsquo;s highway between Weston and
Wenlock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Larden and Lutwyche woods for many years have been famous
for foxes.&nbsp; The late M. Benson, Esq., told us that a fox had
for several seasons made his home securely in a tree near his
house, he having taken care to keep his secret.&nbsp; The woods,
too, <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>on
the opposite side of the ridge, rarely fail to furnish a fox; and
it is difficult to imagine a finer spot than Smallman&rsquo;s
Leap, <a name="citation49a"></a><a href="#footnote49a"
class="citation">[49a]</a> or Ipikin&rsquo;s Rock, on the
&ldquo;Hill Top,&rdquo; presents for viewing a run over Hughley
and Kenley, or between there and Hope Bowdler.&nbsp; Near
Lutwyche is a thick entangled wood, called Mog Forest; and in the
old door of the Church of Easthope, <a name="citation49b"></a><a
href="#footnote49b" class="citation">[49b]</a> near, is a large
iron ring, which is conjectured to have been placed there for
outlaws of the forest who sought sanctuary or freedom from arrest
to take hold of.&nbsp; Now and then, in wandering over the sites
of these former forests, we come upon traditions of great trees,
sometimes upon an aged tree itself, &ldquo;bald with
antiquity,&rdquo; telling of parent forest tracts, like the Lady
Oak at Cressage, which formerly stood in the public highway, and
suffered much from gipsies and other vagabonds lighting <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>fires in its
hollow trunk, but which is now propped, cramped, and cared for,
with as much concern as the Druids were wont to show to similar
trees.&nbsp; A young tree, too, sprung from an acorn from the old
one, has grown up within its hollow trunk, and now mingles its
foliage with that of the parent.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<p>There are a few fine old trees near Willey, supposed to be
fragmentary forest remains.&nbsp; One is <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>a
patriarchal-looking ash in the public road at Barrow; another is
an oak near the Dean; it is one of which the present noble owner
of Willey shows the greatest pride and care.&nbsp; There are also
two noble trees at Shipton and Larden; the one at the latter
place being a fine beech, the branches of which, when tipped with
foliage, have a circumference of 35 yards.&nbsp; A magnificent
oak, recently cut down in Corve Dale, contained 300 cubic feet of
timber, and was 18 feet in circumference.&nbsp; This, however,
was a sapling compared with that king of forest trees which
Loudon describes as having been cut down in Willey Park.&nbsp; It
spread 114 feet, and had a trunk 9 feet in diameter, exclusive of
the bark.&nbsp; It contained 24 cords of yard wood, 11&frac12;
cords of four-feet wood, 252 park palings, six feet long, 1 load
of cooper&rsquo;s wood, 16&frac12; tons of timber in all the
boughs; 28 tons of timber in the body, and this besides fagots
and boughs that had dropped off:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What tales, if there be tongues in
trees,<br />
Those giant oaks could tell,<br />
Of beings born and buried here;<br />
Tales of the peasant and the peer,<br />
Tales of the bridal and the bier<br />
The welcome and farewell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The old oak forests and chestnut groves which supplied <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>the sturdy
framework for the half-timbered houses of our ancestors, the
rafters for their churches, and the beams for their cathedrals,
are gone; and the mischief is, not only that we have lost former
forests, but that our present woods every year are growing less,
that much of that shrubby foliage which within our own
recollection divided the fields, forming little copses in which a
Morland would have revelled, have had to give way to agricultural
improvements, and the objects of sport they sheltered have
disappeared.&nbsp; The badger lingered to the beginning of the
present century along the rocks of Benthall and Apley; and the
otter, which still haunts portions of the Severn and its more
secluded tributaries, and occasionally affords sport in some
parts of the country higher up, was far from being rare.&nbsp; On
the left bank of the Severn are the &ldquo;Brock-holes,&rdquo; or
badger-holes, whilst near to it are the &ldquo;Fox-holes,&rdquo;
where tradition alleges foxes a generation or two ago to have
been numerous enough to have been a nuisance; and the same remark
may apply to the &ldquo;Fox-holes&rdquo; at Benthall.&nbsp; As
the district became more cultivated and the country more
populated, the range of these animals became more and more
circumscribed, and the cherished sports of our forefathers came
to form the staple topics of neighbours&rsquo; oft-told
tales.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>Within
our own recollection the badger was to be found at Benthall Edge;
but he had two enemies&mdash;the fox, who sometimes took
possession of his den and drove him from the place, and the
miners of Broseley and Benthall, who were usually great
dog-fanciers, and who were accustomed to steal forth as the moon
rose above the horizon, and intercept him as he left his long
winding excavation among the rocks, in order to make sport for
them at their annual wakes.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is important, to the completion
of our sketch of the earlier features of the country, that we
cross the Severn and say a word or two respecting the forest of
the Wrekin, of which the early ancestors of the present Willey
family had charge.&nbsp; This famous hill must then have formed a
feature quite as conspicuous in the landscape as it does at
present.&nbsp; As it stood out above the wide-spreading forest
that <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>surrounded it, it must have looked like a barren island
amid a waving sea of green.&nbsp; From its position and outline
too, it appears to have been selected during the struggles which
took place along the borders as a military fortress, judging from
the entrenchments near its summit, and the tumuli both here and
in the valley at its foot, where numbers of broken weapons have
been found.&nbsp; At a later period <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>it is spoken of as Mount St. Gilbert,
in honour, it is said, of a recluse to whom the Gilbertine monks
ascribe their origin.&nbsp; Whether the saint fixed his abode in
the cleft called the Needle&rsquo;s Eye (which tradition alleges
to have been made at the Crucifixion), or on some other part of
the hill, there is no evidence to show; but that there was a
hermitage there at one time, and that whilst the woods around
were stocked with game, is clear.&nbsp; It is charitable to
suppose, however, that the good man who pitched his tent so high
above his fellows abstained from such tempting luxuries, that on
his wooden trencher no king&rsquo;s venison smoked, and that fare
more becoming gown and girdle contented him; so at least it must
have been reported to Henry III., who, to give the hermit,
Nicholas de Denton by name, &ldquo;greater leisure for holy
exercises, and to support him during his life, so long as he
should be a hermit on the aforesaid mountain,&rdquo; granted six
quarters of corn, to be paid by the Sheriff of Shropshire, out of
the issues of Pendleston Mill, near Bridgnorth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>That there were, however, poachers upon the king&rsquo;s
preserves appears from a criminal prosecution recorded on the
Forest Roll of 1209, to the effect that four of the county
sergeants found venison in <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>the house of Hugh le Scot, who took
asylum in a church, and, refusing to quit, &ldquo;there lived a
month,&rdquo; but afterwards &ldquo;escaped in woman&rsquo;s
clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certain sales of forest land made by Henry II. near the
Wrekin, and entered on the Forest Roll of 1180, together with the
assessments and perambulations of later periods, afford some idea
of the extent of this forest, which, from the Severn and the
limits of Shrewsbury, swept round by Tibberton and Chetwynd to
the east, and included Lilleshall, St. George&rsquo;s, Dawley,
Shifnal, Kemberton, and Madeley on the south.&nbsp; From the
&ldquo;Survey of Shropshire Forests&rdquo; in 1235, it appears
that the following woods were subject to its jurisdiction:
Leegomery, Wrockwardine Wood, Eyton-on-the-Weald Moors,
Lilleshall, Sheriffhales, the Lizard, Stirchley, and Great
Dawley.&nbsp; A later perambulation fixed the bounds of the royal
preserve, or Haye of Wellington, in which two burnings of lime
for the use of the crown are recorded, as well as the fact that
three hundred oak-trees were consumed in the operation.</p>
<p>Hugh Forester, and Robert the Forester, are spoken of as
tenants of the crown in connection with this Haye; and it is an
interesting coincidence that the land originally granted by one
of the Norman <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>earls, or by King Henry I., for the custody of this
Haye, which included what is now called Hay Gate, is still in
possession of the present noble owner of Willey.&nbsp; It seems
singular, however, that in the &ldquo;Arundel Rolls&rdquo; of
1255, it should be described as a <i>pourpresture</i>, for which
eighteen pence per acre was paid to the king, as being held by
the said Robert Forester towards the custody of the Wellington
Haia.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>Among
the perquisites which the said Robert Forester was allowed, as
Keeper of the Haye, all dead wood and windfalls are mentioned,
unless more than five oak-trees were blown down at a time, in
which case they went to the king.&nbsp; The Haye is spoken of
here as an &ldquo;imparkment,&rdquo; which agrees with the
descriptions of Chaucer and other old writers, who speak of a
Haia as a place paled in, or enclosed, into which deer or other
game were driven, as they now drive deer in North America, or
elephants in India, and of grants of land made to those whose
especial duty it was to drive the deer with their troop of
followers from all parts of a wide circle into such enclosure for
slaughter.&nbsp; The following description of deer-hunting in the
seventeenth century by Taylor, the Water Poet, as he is called,
will enable us to understand the plan pursued by the Norman
sportsmen:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Five or six hundred men do rise early in
the morning, and they do disperse themselves divers ways; and
seven, eight, or ten miles&rsquo; compass, they do bring or chase
in the deer in many herds (two, three, or four hundred in a herd)
to such a place as the noblemen shall appoint them; then, when
the day is come, the lords and gentlemen of their companies <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>do ride or go
to the said places, sometimes wandering up to the middle through
bourns, and rivers; and then, they being come to the place, do
lie down on the ground till those foresaid scouts, which are
called the Tinkheldt, do bring down the deer.&nbsp; Then, after
we had stayed three hours or there abouts, we might perceive the
deer appear on the hills round about us (their heads making a
show like a wood), which being followed close by the Tinkheldt,
are chased down into the valley where we lay; then all the valley
on each side being waylaid with a hundred couple of strong Irish
greyhounds, they are let loose as occasion serves upon the herd
of deer, that with dogs, guns, arrows, dirks, and daggers, in the
space of two hours fourscore fat deer were slain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hunting matches were sometimes made in these forests, and one,
embittered by some family feud respecting a fishery, terminated
in the death of a bold and ancient knight, an event recorded upon
a stone covering his remains in the quaint and truly ancient
church at Atcham.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The bugle sounds, &rsquo;tis
Berwick&rsquo;s lord<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er Wrekin drives the deer;<br />
That hunting match&mdash;that fatal feud&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drew many a widow&rsquo;s tear.</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>&ldquo;With deep-mouthed talbe to rouse the game<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His generous bosom warms,<br />
Till furious foemen check the chase<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dare the din of arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then fell the high-born Malveysin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His limbs besmeared with gore;<br />
No more his trusty bow shall twang,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His bugle blow no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whilst Ridware mourns her last brave son<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In arms untimely slain,<br />
With kindred grief she here records<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The last of Berwick&rsquo;s train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert Forester appears to have had charge not only of the
Haye of the Wrekin, but also of that of <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Morfe, for
both of which he is represented as answering at the Assizes in
February, 1262, for the eight years then past.&nbsp; A Robert
Forester is also described as one chosen with the sheriff, the
chief forester, and verderers of Shropshire in 1242, to try the
question touching the <i>expeditation</i> of dogs on the estates
of the Lilleshall Abbey, and his seal still remains attached to
the juror&rsquo;s return now in possession of the Sutherland
family at Trentham.</p>
<p>A Roger de Wellington, whom Mr. Eyton calls Roger le Forester
the second, is also described as one of six royal
foresters-of-the-fee, who, on June 6th, 1300, met to assist at
the great perambulation of Shropshire forests.&nbsp; He was
admitted a burgess of Shrewsbury in 1319.&nbsp; John Forester,
his son and heir, it is supposed, was baptised at Wellington, and
attained his majority in 1335; <a name="citation63"></a><a
href="#footnote63" class="citation">[63]</a> and a John
Forester&mdash;a lineal descendant of his&mdash;obtained the
singular grant, now at Willey, from Henry VIII., privileging him
to wear his hat in the royal presence.&nbsp; After the usual
formalities the grant proceeds:&mdash;&ldquo;Know all men, our
officers, ministers, &amp;c.&nbsp; Forasmuch as we be credibly
informed that our trusty and well-beloved <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>John Foster,
of Wellington, in the county of Salop, Gentilman, for certain
diseases and infirmities which he has on his hede, cannot
consequently, without great danger and jeopardy, be discovered of
the same.&nbsp; Whereupon we, in consideration thereof, by these
presents, licenced hym from henceforth to use and were his bonet
on his said hede,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>It will be observed that in this grant the name occurs in its
abridged form as Foster, and in the Sheriffs of Shropshire and
many old documents it is variously spelt as Forester, Forster,
and Foster, a circumstance which during the progress of the
present work suggested an inquiry, the result of
which&mdash;mainly through the researches of a painstaking
friend&mdash;may add weight and interest to the
arch&aelig;ological lore previously collected in connection with
the family.&nbsp; It appears, for instance, that the Anthony
Foster of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kenilworth&rdquo; was
descended from the Foresters of Wellington; that he held the
manor of Little Wenlock and other property in Shropshire in 1545;
that the Richard Forester or Forster who built the interesting
half-timbered mansion, <a name="citation64"></a><a
href="#footnote64" class="citation">[64]</a> still standing in <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>the Cartway,
Bridgnorth, where Bishop Percy, the author of
&ldquo;Percy&rsquo;s Reliques,&rdquo; was born, was also a
member; and that Anne, the daughter of this Richard Forester or
Forster, was married in 1575 at Sutton Maddock to William Baxter,
the antiquary, <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>mentioned by the Rev. George Bellet at page 183 of the
&ldquo;Antiquities of Bridgnorth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Bellet,
speaking of another mansion of the Foresters at Bridgnorth, says,
&ldquo;One could wish, as a mere matter of curiosity, that a
remarkable building, called &lsquo;Forester&rsquo;s Folly,&rsquo;
had been amongst those which escaped the fire; for it was built
by Richard Forester, the private secretary of no less famous a
person than Bishop Bonner, and bore the above appellation most
likely on account of the cost of its erection.&rdquo;&nbsp;
William Baxter, who, it will be seen, was a descendant of the
Foresters, has an interesting passage in his life referring to
the circumstance. <a name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66"

</a></p>
<p>We believe that the Forester pedigree in the MS. collection of
Shropshire pedigrees, now in possession of Sidney Stedman Smith,
Esq., compiled by that careful and painstaking genealogist the
late Mr. Hardwick, fully confirms this, and shows that the
Foresters of Watling Street, the Foresters or Forsters of Sutton
Maddock, and the Forsters or Fosters of Evelith Manor were the
same family.&nbsp; The arms, like the names, differ; but all have
the hunter&rsquo;s horn stringed; and if any doubt existed as to
the identity of the families, it is still <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>further
removed by a little work entitled &ldquo;An Inquiry concerning
the death of Amy Robsart,&rdquo; by S. J. Pettigrew, F.R.S.,
F.S.A.&nbsp; Mr. Pettigrew says: &ldquo;Anthony Forster was the
fourth son of Richard Forster, of Evelith, in Shropshire, by
Mary, daughter of Sir Thomas Gresley, of an ancient family.&nbsp;
The Anthony Forster of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s novel is supposed
to have been born about 1510; and a relative, Thomas, was the
prior of an ecclesiastical establishment at Wombridge, the warden
of Tong, and the vicar of Idsall, as appears by his altar-tomb in
Shifnal Church.&nbsp; He is conjectured to have attended to the
early education of Anthony, whose after-connection with Berks is
accounted for by the fact that he married somewhere between 1530
and 1540 a Berkshire lady, Ann, daughter of Reginald Williams,
eldest son of Sir John Williams.&nbsp; He purchased Cumnor Place,
in Berks, of William Owen, son of Dr. G. Owen, physician to Henry
VIII.&nbsp; He was not, therefore, as Sir Walter Scott alleges, a
tenant of the Earl of Leicester, to whom, however, he left Cumnor
Place by will at his death in 1572.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is gratifying
to find that Mr. Pettigrew, in his &ldquo;Inquiry,&rdquo; shows
how groundless was the charge built up by Sir Walter Scott
against the Earl of <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>Leicester; and, what is still more to our purpose, that
he completely clears the character of Anthony Forster, who was
supposed to have been the agent in the foul deed, of the
imputation, and shows him to have been quite a different
character to that represented by this distinguished writer.&nbsp;
This, indeed, may be inferred from the fact that Anthony Forster
not only enjoyed the confidence of his neighbours, but so grew in
favour with the people of Abingdon that he acceded in 1570 to the
representation of that borough, and continued to represent it
till he died; also, from the inscription on his tomb, which is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Anthonius Forster, generis generosa
propago,<br />
Cumner&aelig; Dominus Barcheriensis erat;<br />
Armiger, Armigero prognatus patre Ricardo,<br />
Qui quondam Iphleth&aelig; Salopiensis erat.<br />

Ex isto Antonius stemmate quartus erat.<br />
Mente sagax, animo pr&aelig;cellens, corpore promptus;<br />

In factis probitas fuit, in sermonte venustas,<br />
In vultu gravitas, religione fides;<br />
In patriam pietas, in egenos grata voluntas,<br />
Accedunt reliquis annumeranda bonis:<br />
Sic quod cuncta rapit, rapuit non omnia Lethum,<br />
Sed qu&aelig; Mors rapuit, vivida fama dedit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then follow these laudatory verses:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

</blockquote>
<p>Cleared of the slanders which had been so unjustly heaped upon
his memory, one can welcome Anthony Forster, the Squire of
Cumnor, as a member of the same distinguished family from which
the Willey Squire and the present ennobled house of Willey are
descended. <a name="citation69"></a><a href="#footnote69"

</a></p>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> commence with its earlier phase,
it was clear that Willey would be close neighbour to the Royal
Chace of Shirlot, and that it must have been about the centre of
the wooded country previously described.&nbsp; The name is said
to be of Saxon origin; and in wattle and dab and wicker-work
times, when an osier-bed was probably equal in value to a
vineyard, the place might have been as the word seems <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>to suggest,
one where willows grew, seeing that various osiers, esteemed by
basket makers, coopers, and turners, still flourish along the
stream winding past it to the Severn.&nbsp; The name is therefore
redolent of the olden time, and is one of those old word-pictures
which so often occur to indicate the earlier features of the
country.&nbsp; Under its agricultural Saxon holders, however,
Willey so grew in value and importance that when the Conquest was
complete, and King William&rsquo;s generals were settling down to
enjoy the good things the Saxons had provided, and as Byron has
it&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Manors<br
/>
Were their reward for following Billy&rsquo;s banners,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Willey fell to the lot of a Norman, named Turold, who, as he
held twelve other manors, considerately permitted the Saxon owner
to continue in possession under him.&nbsp; Domesday says:
&ldquo;The same Turold holds Willey, and Hunnit (holds it) of
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is half a hide geldable.&nbsp; Here
is arable land sufficient for ii ox teams.&nbsp; Here those ox
teams are, together with ii villains, and ii boors.&nbsp; Its
value is v shillings.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the death of Hunnit the
manor passed to a family which took its name from the place; and
considerable additions resulted from <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>the marriage of one, Warner de
Williley, with the heiress of Roger Fitz Odo, of Kenley.&nbsp;
Warner de Williley appears to have been a person of some
consequence, from the fact that he was appointed to make inquiry
concerning certain encroachments upon the royal forests of
Shropshire; but an act of oppression and treachery, in which his
wife had taken a part, against one of his own vassals, whose land
he coveted, caused him to be committed to prison.&nbsp; Several
successive owners of Willey were overseers of Shirlot Forest; and
Nicholas, son and heir of Warner, was sued for inattention to his
duties; an under tenant also, profiting probably by the laxity of
his lord, at a later period was charged and found guilty of
taking a stag from the king&rsquo;s preserves, on Sunday, June
6th, 1253.&nbsp; Andrew de Williley joined Mountford against King
Edward, and fell August 4th, 1265, in the battle of Evesham; in
consequence of which act of disloyalty the property was forfeited
to the crown, and the priors of Wenlock, who already had the
seigniory usual to feudal lords, availing themselves of the
opportunity, managed so to increase their power that a subsequent
tenant, as shown by the Register at Willey, came to Wenlock
(1388), and &ldquo;before <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>many witnesses did homage and
fealty,&rdquo; and acknowledged himself to hold the place of the
lord prior by carrying his frock to parliament.&nbsp; They
succeeded too, after several suits, in establishing their rights
to the advowson of the Church, founded and endowed by the lords
of the place.</p>
<p>By the middle of the 16th century Willey had passed to the
hands of the old Catholic family of the Lacons, one of whom, Sir
Roland, held it in 1561, together with Kinlet; and from them it
passed to Sir John Weld, who is mentioned as of Willey in
1666.&nbsp; He married the daughter of Sir George Whitmore, and
his son, George Weld, sat for the county with William Forester,
who married the daughter of the Earl of Salisbury, and voted with
him in favour of the succession of the House of Hanover.</p>
<p>Who among the former feudal owners of Willey built the old
hall, is a question which neither history nor tradition serves to
solve.&nbsp; Portions of the basement of the old buildings seem
to indicate former structures still more ancient, like spurs of
some primitive rock cropping up into a subsequent
formation.&nbsp; Contrasted with the handsome modern freestone
mansion occupied by the Right Hon. Lord <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Forester
close by, the remains shown in our engraving look like a stranded
wreck, past which centuries of English life have gone sweeping
by.&nbsp; Some of the walls are three feet in thickness, and the
buttressed chimneys, and small-paned windows&mdash;&ldquo;set
deep in the grey old tower&rdquo;&mdash;make it a fair type of
country mansions and a realisation of ideas such as the mind
associates with the homes of the early owners of Willey.</p>
<p>Although occupying a slight eminence, it really nestles in the
hollow, and in its buff-coloured livery it stands pleasingly
relieved by the high ground of Shirlot and its woods
beyond.&nbsp; In looking upon its quaint gables, shafts, and
chimneys, one feels that when it was complete it must have had
something of the poetry of ancient art about it.&nbsp; Its
irregularities of outline must have fitted in, as it were, with
the undulating landscape, with which its walls are now tinted
into harmony, by brown and yellow lichens.&nbsp; There was
nothing assuming or pretentious about it; it was content to stand
close neighbour to the public old coach road, which came winding
by from Bridgnorth to Wenlock, and passed beneath the arch which
now connects the high-walled gardens with the shaded walk leading
to its <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>modern neighbour, the present mansion of the
Foresters.</p>
<p>Sir Walter Scott, in his description of Cumnor Place, speaks
of woods closely adjacent, full of large trees, and in particular
of ancient and mighty oaks, which stretched their giant arms over
the high wall surrounding the demesne, thus giving it a secluded
and monastic appearance.&nbsp; He describes its formal walks and
avenues as in part choked up with grass, and interrupted by
billets, and piles of brushwood, and he tells us of the
old-fashioned gateway in the outer wall, and of the door formed
of two huge oaken leaves, thickly studded with nails&mdash;like
the gate of an old town.&nbsp; This picture of the approaches to
the old mansion where Anthony Foster lived was no doubt a more
faithful representation than the one he gave of the character of
the man himself.&nbsp; At any rate, it is one which would in many
respects apply to old Willey Hall and its surroundings at the
time to which the great novelist refers.&nbsp; Everything was old
and old-fashioned, even as its owners prided themselves it should
be, and as grey as time and an uninterrupted growth of lichens in
a congenial atmosphere could make it.&nbsp; Hollies, yews, and
junipers were to be seen in the grounds, and <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>outside were
oaks and other aged trees, scathed by lightning&rsquo;s bolt and
winter&rsquo;s blast.&nbsp; Here and there stood a few monarchs
of the old forest in groups, each group a brotherhood sublime,
carrying the thoughts back to the days when &ldquo;from glade to
glade, through wild copse and tangled dell, the wild deer
bounded.&rdquo;&nbsp; Trees, buildings, loose stones that had
fallen, and still lay where they fell, were mossed with a hoar
antiquity.&nbsp; Everything in fact seemed to say that the place
had a history of its own, and that it could tell a tale of the
olden time.</p>
<p>From the lawn and grounds adjoining a path led to the
flower-gardens, intersected by gravel walks and grassy terraces,
where a sun-dial stood, and where fountains, fed by copious
supplies from unfailing springs on the high grounds of Shirlot,
threw silvery showers above the shadows of the trees into the
sunlight.</p>
<p>Willey, augmented by tracts of Shirlot, which was finally
disafforested and apportioned two centuries since, came into
possession of the Foresters by the marriage of Brook Forester, of
Dothill Park, with Elizabeth, only surviving child and heiress of
George Weld, of Willey; and George Forester, &ldquo;the Squire of
Willey,&rdquo; was the fruit of that marriage.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE WILLEY SQUIRE.</span></h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Squire Forester&mdash;His Instincts and
Tendencies&mdash;Atmosphere of the Times favourable for their
Development&mdash;Thackeray&rsquo;s Opinion&mdash;Style of
Hunting&mdash;Dawn of the Golden Age of Fox-hunting, &amp;c.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> will be seen that around Willey
and Willey Hall, associations crowd which serve to make the place
a household word and Squire Forester a man of <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>mark with
modern sportsmen and future Nimrods, at any rate if we consent to
regard the Squire&rsquo;s characteristics as outcrops of the
instincts of an ancient stock.&nbsp; Descended from an ancestry
so associated with forest sports and pursuits, he was like a
moving plant which receives its nourishment from the air, and he
lived chiefly through his senses.&nbsp; He was waylaid, as it
were, on life&rsquo;s path by hereditary tendencies, and his
career was chequered by indulgences which, read in the light of
the present day, look different from what they then did, when at
court and in the country there were many to keep him in
countenance.&nbsp; At any rate, Squire Forester lived in what may
be called the dawn of the golden age of fox-hunting.&nbsp; We say
dawn, because although Lord Arundel kept a pack of hounds some
time between 1690 and 1700, and Sir John Tyrwhitt and Charles
Pelham, Esq., did so in 1713, yet as Lord Wilton, in his
&ldquo;Sports and Pursuits of the English&rdquo; states, the
first real pack of foxhounds was established in the West of
England about 1730.&nbsp; It was a period when, for various
reasons, a reaction in favour of the manly sports of
England&rsquo;s earlier days had set in, one being the discovery
that those distinguished for such sports were they who assisted
most in winning on the <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>battle-fields of the Continent the
victories which made the British arms so renowned.&nbsp; Then, as
now, it was found that they led to the development of the
physical frame&mdash;sometimes to the removal of absolute
maladies, and supplied the raw material of manliness out of which
heroes are made&mdash;a view which the Duke of Wellington in some
measure confirmed by the remark that the best officers he had
under him during the Peninsular War were those whom he discovered
to be bold riders to hounds.&nbsp; Lord Wilton, in his book just
quoted, goes still further, by contending that &ldquo;the
greatness and glory of Great Britain are in no slight degree
attributable to her national sports and pastimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That such sports contributed to the jollity and rollicking fun
which distinguished the time in which Squire Forester lived,
there can be little doubt.&nbsp; In his &ldquo;Four
Georges,&rdquo; Thackeray gives it as his opinion, that
&ldquo;the England of our ancestors was a merrier England than
the island we inhabit,&rdquo; and that the people, high and low,
amused themselves very much more.&nbsp; &ldquo;One hundred and
twenty years ago,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;every town had its fair,
and every village its wake.&nbsp; The old poets have sung a
hundred jolly ditties about great cudgel playings, <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>famous
grinnings through horse-collars, great Maypole meetings, and
morris-dances.&nbsp; The girls used to run races, clad in very
light attire; and the kind gentry and good parsons thought no
shame in looking on.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds, &ldquo;I have
calculated the manner in which statesmen and persons of condition
passed their time; and what with drinking and dining, and supping
and cards, wonder how they managed to get through their business
at all.&rdquo;&nbsp; That they did manage to work, and to get
through a considerable amount of it, is quite clear; and probably
they did so with all the more ease in consequence of the
amusement which often came first, as in the case of
&ldquo;Naughty idle Bobby,&rdquo; as Clive was called when a boy;
and not less so in that of Pitt, who did so much to develop that
spirit of patriotism of which we boast.&nbsp; It was a remark of
Addison, that &ldquo;those who have searched most into human
nature observe that nothing so much shows the nobleness of the
soul as that its felicity consists in action;&rdquo; and that
&ldquo;every man has such an active principle in him that he will
find out something to employ himself upon in whatever place or
state he is posted.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Those familiar with the <i>Spectator</i> will remember <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>that he
represents himself to have become so enamoured of the chase, that
in his letters from the country he says: &ldquo;I intend to hunt
twice a week during my stay with Sir Roger, and shall prescribe
the moderate use of this exercise to all my country friends as
the best kind of physic for mending a bad constitution and
preserving a good one.&rdquo;&nbsp; He concludes with the
following quotation from Dryden:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The first physicians by debauch were
made;<br />
Excess began, and sloth sustains the trade:<br />
By chase our long-liv&rsquo;d fathers earned their food;<br />
Toil strung their arms and purified their blood.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But a country squire of Mr. Forester&rsquo;s day even more
pithily and quaintly expresses himself as to the advantages to be
derived from out-door sports:&mdash;&ldquo;Those useful hours
that our fathers employed on horseback in the fields,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;are lost to their posterity between a stinking pair
of sheets.&nbsp; Balls and operas, assemblies and masquerades, so
exhaust the spirits of the puny creatures over-night, that
yawning and chocolate are the main labours and entertainments of
the morning.&nbsp; The important affairs of barber, milliner,
perfumer, and looking-glass, are their employ till the call to
dinner, and the bottle or gaming table demand the tedious hours
that intervene <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>before the return of the evening assignations.&nbsp;
What wonder, then, if such busy, trifling, effeminate mortals are
heard to swear they have no notion of venturing their bodies
out-of-doors in the cold air in the morning?&nbsp; I have laughed
heartily to see such delicate smock-faced animals judiciously
interrupting their pinches of snuff with dull jokes upon
fox-hunters; and foppishly declaiming against an art they know no
more of than they do of Greek.&nbsp; It cannot be expected they
should speak well of a toil they dare not undertake; or that the
fine things should be fit to work without doors, which are of the
taylor&rsquo;s creation.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> style of hunting in vogue in
Squire Forester&rsquo;s day was, in the opinion of authorities on

endurance than now.&nbsp; The late Mr. Thursfield, of Barrow, was
wont to say that it was no unusual thing to see Moody taking the

himself, like most other sportsmen of the period, was an early
man.</p>

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>Col. Apperley says: &ldquo;With our forefathers, when the
roost-cock sounded his clarion, they sounded their horn, throwing
off the pack so soon as they could distinguish a stile from a
gate, or, in other words, so soon as they could see to ride to
the hounds.&nbsp; Then it was that the hare was hunted to her
form by the trail, and the fox to his kennel by the drag.&nbsp;
Slow as this system would be deemed, it was a grand treat to the
real sportsman.&nbsp; What, in the language of the chase, is
called the &lsquo;tender-nosed hound,&rsquo; had an opportunity
of displaying itself to the inexpressible delight of his master;
and to the field&mdash;that is, to the sportsmen who joined in
the diversion&mdash;the pleasures of the day were enhanced by the
moments of anticipation produced by the drag.&nbsp; As the scent
grew warmer, the certainty of finding was confirmed; the music of
the pack increased; and the game being up, away went the hounds
in a crash.&nbsp; Both trail and drag are at present <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>but little
thought of.&nbsp; Hounds merely draw over ground most likely to
hold the game they are in quest of, and thus, in a great measure,
rely upon chance for coming across it; for if a challenge be
heard, it can only be inferred that a fox has been on foot in the
night&mdash;the scent being seldom sufficient to carry the hounds
up to his kennel.&nbsp; Advantages, however, as far as sport is
concerned, attend the present hour of meeting in the field,
independently of the misery of riding many miles in the dark,
which sportsmen in the early part of the last century were
obliged to do.&nbsp; The game, when it is now aroused, is in a
better state to encounter the great speed of modern hounds;
having had time to digest the food it has partaken of in the
night previous to its being stirred.&nbsp; But it is only since
the great increase of hares and foxes that the aid of the trail
and drag could be dispensed with without the frequent recurrence
of blank days, which now seldom happen.&nbsp; Compared with the
luxurious ease with which the modern sportsman is conveyed to the
field&mdash;either lolling in his chaise and four, or galloping
along at the rate of twenty miles an hour on a hundred-guinea
hack&mdash;the situation of his predecessor was all but
distressing.&nbsp; In proportion to the <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>distance he
had to ride by starlight were his hours of rest broken in upon,
and exclusive of the time that operation might consume another
serious one was to be provided for&mdash;this was the filling his
hair with powder and pomatum until it could hold no more, and
forming it into a well-formed knot, or club, as it was called, by
his valet, which cost commonly a good hour&rsquo;s work.&nbsp;
The protecting mud boots, the cantering hack, the second horse in
the field, were luxuries unknown to him.&nbsp; His well-soiled
buckskins, and brown-topped boots, would have cut an indifferent
figure in the presence of a modern connoisseur by a
Leicestershire cover side.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Notwithstanding
all this, however,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;we are inclined
strongly to suspect that, out of a given number of gentlemen
taking the field with hounds, the proportion of really scientific
sportsmen may have been in favour of the olden times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Willey Kennels were within easy reach of the Hall, between
Willey and Shirlot, where the pleasant stream before alluded to
goes murmuring on its way through the Smithies to the
Severn.&nbsp; But in order to save his dogs unnecessary exertion
there were others on the opposite, or Wrekin, side of the
river&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>&ldquo;Hounds stout and healthy,<br />
Earths well stopped, and foxes plenty,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>being mottoes of the period.&nbsp; The dogs were of the
&ldquo;heavy painstaking breed&rdquo; that &ldquo;stooped to
their work.&rdquo;&nbsp; How, it was said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Can the fox-hound ever tell,<br />
Unless by pains he takes to smell,<br />
Where Reynard&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Experience taught the Squire the importance of a principle now
more generally acted upon, that of selecting the qualities
required in the hounds he bred from; and by this means he
obtained developments of swiftness and scent that made his pack
one good horses only of that day could keep up with.&nbsp; He
prided himself much upon the blood of his best hounds, knew every
one he had by name, and was familiar with its pedigree.&nbsp;
Portraits of four of his favourites were painted on canvas and
hung in the hall, with lines beneath expressive of their
qualities, and the dates at which the paintings were made.&nbsp;
The Right Hon. Lord Forester takes great care of these, as
showing in what way the best dogs of that day differed from those
of the present; and through his kindness we have been enabled to
get drawings made, of which his lordship <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>was pleased
to approve, and we fancy there is no better judge living.</p>
<p>Three of these are shown in our engraving at the head of this
chapter.</p>
<p>Pigmy, the bitch in the group nearest to the fox, is said to
have been the smallest hound then known.&nbsp; Underneath the
portrait are the following lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Behold in miniature the foxhound keen,<br
/>

As champion here the beauteous Pigmy stands,<br />
She challenges the globe, both home and foreign lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1773.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The one the farthest from the fox, is a white dog, Pilot; and
underneath the painting is the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pilot rewards his master Rowley&rsquo;s
care,<br />
And swift as lightning skims the transient air;<br />
Famed for the chase, from cover always first,<br />
His tongue and sterne proclaimed an arrant burst.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1774.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dog in front, with his head thrown up, is Childers; and
underneath the picture are these lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sportsmen look up, old Childers&rsquo;
picture view,<br />
His virtues many were, his failings few;<br />
Reynard with dread oft heard his awful name,<br />
And grateful Musters thus rewards his fame.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1772.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>The
following letters from Mr. Forester to Walter Stubbs, Esq., of
Beckbury, afterwards of Stratford-on-Avon, where he became
distinguished in connection with the Warwickshire Hunt, show how
particular he was in his selection.&nbsp; It would seem that
whilst admiring the Duke of Grafton&rsquo;s hounds, which under
the celebrated Tom Rose (&ldquo;Honest old Tom,&rdquo; as he was
called), who used to say, &ldquo;a man must breed his pack to
suit his country,&rdquo; gained some celebrity, he not
unnaturally preferred his own.&nbsp; We give exact copies of two
of his letters, they are so characteristic of the man.&nbsp; In
all the letters we have seen he began with a considerable margin
at the side of the paper, but always filled up the space with a
postscript:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span

sort from his Grace&rsquo;s own hands.&nbsp; I have sent you (as
a present) a little bitch of ye Grafton kind, which I call
Whymsy, lately taken up from quarters, and coming towards a year
old.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s rather under size for me, or otherwise I
see not her fault.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s, in my opinion, <i>a true
Non-Pareil</i>.&nbsp; Your acceptance of her from me <i>now</i>,

</a></p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> portrait at the head of this
chapter is from a carefully drawn copy of a painting at Willey of
a <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>favourite hound of the Squire&rsquo;s, just a hundred
years ago.</p>
<p>Dibdin, in his song of Tom Moody, speaks of &ldquo;a country
well known to him fifty miles round;&rdquo; and this was no mere
figure of speech, as the hunting ground of the Willey Squire
extended over the greater part of the forest lands we have
described.&nbsp; There were fewer packs of hounds in Shropshire
then, and the Squire had a clear field extending from the Clee
Hills to the Needle&rsquo;s Eye on the Wrekin, through which, on
one remarkable occasion, the hounds are reported to have followed
their fox.&nbsp; The Squire sometimes went beyond these notable
landmarks, the day never appearing to be too long for him.</p>
<p>Four o&rsquo;clock on a hunting morning usually found him
preparing the inner man with a breakfast of underdone beef, with
eggs beaten up in brandy to fill the interstices; and thus
fortified he was ready for a fifty miles run.&nbsp; He was what
Nimrod would have called, &ldquo;a good rough rider&rdquo; over
the stiff Shropshire clays, and he generally managed to keep up
with the best to the last;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nicking and craning he deemed a crime,<br
/>
And nobody rode harder perhaps in his time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>He
could scarcely &ldquo;Top a flight of rails,&rdquo; &ldquo;Skim
ridge and furrow,&rdquo; or, charge a fence, however, with
Ph&oelig;be Higgs, who sometimes accompanied him.</p>
<p>Ph&oelig;be, who was a complete Diana, and would take
hazardous leaps, beckoning Mr. Forester to follow her
extraordinary feats, led the Squire to wager heavy sums that in
leaping she would beat any woman in England.&nbsp; With
Ph&oelig;be and Moody, and a few choice spirits of the same stamp
on a scent, there was no telling to what point between the two
extremities of the Severn it might carry them.&nbsp; They might
turn-up some few miles from its source or its estuary, and not be
heard of at Willey for a week.&nbsp; One long persevering run
into Radnorshire, in which a few plucky riders continued the pace
for some distance and then left the field to the Squire and
Moody, with one or two others, who kept the heads of their
favourites in the direction Reynard was leading, passed into a
tradition; but the brush appears not to have been fairly won, a
gamekeeper having sent a shot through the leg of the
&ldquo;varmint&rdquo; as he saw him taking shelter in a
churchyard&mdash;an event commemorated in some doggrel lines
still current.</p>
<p>Very romantic tales are told of long runs by a <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>superannuated
servant of the Foresters, old Simkiss, who had them from his
father; but we forbear troubling the reader with more than an
outline of one of these, that of Old Tinker.&nbsp; Old Tinker was
the name of a fox, with more than the usual cunning of his
species, that had often proved more than a match for the hounds;
and one morning the Squire, having made up his mind for a run,
repaired to Tickwood, where this fox was put up.&nbsp; On hearing
the dogs in full cry the Squire vowed he would &ldquo;Follow the
devil this time to hell&rsquo;s doors but he would catch
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Reynard, it appears, went off in the direction
of the Clee Hills; but took a turn, and made for Thatcher&rsquo;s
Coppice; from there to the Titterstone Hill, and then back to
Tickwood, where the hounds again ousted him, and over the same
ground again.&nbsp; On arriving at the Brown Clee Hills the
huntsman&rsquo;s horse was so blown that he took Moody&rsquo;s,
sending Tom with his own to the nearest inn to get spiced ale and
a feed.&nbsp; By this time the fox was on his way back, and the
horse on which Tom was seated no sooner heard the horn sounding
than he dashed away and joined in the chase.&nbsp; Ten couples of
fresh hounds were now set loose at the kennels in Willey Hollow,
and these <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>again turned the fox in the direction of Aldenham, but
all besides Moody were now far behind, and his horse fell dead
beneath him.&nbsp; The dogs, too, had had enough; they refused to
go further, and Old Tinker once more beat his pursuers, but only
to die in a drain on the Aldenham estate, where he was found a
week afterwards.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A braver choice of dauntless spirits
never<br />
Dash&rsquo;d after hound,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it is said, and to commemorate one of the good things of this
kind, a long home-spun ditty was wont to be sung in public-houses
by tenants on the estate, the first few lines of which were as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Salopians every one,<br />
Of high and low degree,<br />
Who take delight in fox-hunting,<br />
Come listen unto me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A story true I&rsquo;ll tell to you<br />
Concerning of a fox,<br />
How they hunted him on Tickwood side<br />
O&rsquo;er Benthall Edge and rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Says Reynard, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take you o&rsquo;er to
Willey Park<br />
Above there, for when we fairly get aground<br />
I value neither huntsmen all<br />
Nor Squire Forester&rsquo;s best hound.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know your dogs are stout and good,<br />
That they&rsquo;ll run me like the wind!<br />
But I&rsquo;ll tread lightly on the land,<br />
And leave no scent behind.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other verses describe the hunt, and Reynard, on being run to
earth, asking for quarter on condition that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He will both promise and fulfil,<br />
Neither ducks nor geese to kill,<br />
Nor lambs upon the hill;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and how bold Ranter, with little faith in his promise,
&ldquo;seized him by the neck and refused to let him
go.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is one of many specimens of a like kind still
current among old people.&nbsp; An old man, speaking of Mr.
Stubbs, for whom, he remarked, the day was never too long, and
who at its close would sometimes urge his brother sportsmen to
draw for a fresh fox, with the reminder that there was a moon to
kill by, said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One of the rummiest things my father, who
hunted with the Squire, told me, was a run by moonlight.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not sure, but I think Mr. Dansey, Mr. Childe, and Mr.
Stubbs, if not Mr. Meynell, were at the Hall.&nbsp; They came
sometimes, and sometimes the Squire visited them.&nbsp;
Howsomeever, there were three or four couples of fresh hounds at
the kennels, and it was proposed to have <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>an
after-dinner run.&nbsp; They dined early, and, as nigh as I can
tell, it was three o&rsquo;clock when they left the Hall, after
the Beggarlybrook fox.&nbsp; Mind that was a fox, that
was&mdash;he was.&nbsp; He was a dark brown one, and a cunning
beggar too, that always got off at the edge of a wood, by running
first along a wall and then leaping part of the way down an old
coal pit, which had run in at the sides.&nbsp; Well, they placed
three couples of hounds near to this place in readiness, and the
hark-in having been given, the gorse soon began to shake, and a
hound or two were seen outside, and amongst them old Pilot, who
now and then took a turn outside, and turned in, lashing his
stern, and giving the right token.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have at
him!&rsquo; shouted one; &lsquo;Get ready!&rsquo; said another;
&lsquo;Hold hard a bit, we shall have him, for a hundred!&rsquo;
shouted the Squire.&nbsp; Then comes a tally-ho, said my father,
and off they go; every hound out of cover, sterns up, carrying a
beautiful head, and horses all in a straight line along the open,
with the scent breast high.&nbsp; Reynard making straight for the
tongue of the coppice, finds himself circumvented, and fresh
hounds being let loose, he makes for Wenlock Walton as though he
was going to give &rsquo;em an airing on the hill-top.</p>
<p><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;But, headed and foiled, his first point
he forsook,<br />
And merrily led them a dance o&rsquo;er the brook.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some lime burners coming from work turned him, and,
leaving Wenlock on the left, he made for Tickwood.&nbsp; It was
now getting dark, and the ground being awkward, one or two were
down.&nbsp; The Squire swore he would have the varmint out of
Tickwood; and the hounds working well, and old Trumpeter&rsquo;s
tongue being heard on the lower <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>side, one challenged the other, and
they soon got into line in the hollow, the fox leading.&nbsp;
Stragglers got to the scent, and off they went by the burnt
houses, where the Squire&rsquo;s horse rolled over into a
sand-pit.&nbsp; The fox made for the Severn, but turned in the
direction of Buildwas, and was run into in the moonlight, among
the ivied ruins of the Abbey.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have already described the
exterior of the Hall and its approaches.&nbsp; In the interior of
the building the same air of antiquity reigned.&nbsp; Its
capacious chimney-pieces, and rooms wainscoted with oak to the
ceiling, are familiar from the descriptions of an old friend,
whose memory was still fresh and green as regards events and
scenes of the time when the Hall stood entire, and who when a boy
was not an unfrequent visitor.&nbsp; Like Crabbe&rsquo;s Peter
among the rooms and galleries of Ilford Hall,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His vast delight was mixed with equal
awe,<br />
There was such magic in the things he saw;<br />
Portraits he passed, admiring, but with pain<br />
Turned from some objects, nor would look again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>Against the walls were grim old portraits of the
Squire&rsquo;s predecessors of the Weld and Forester lines, with
stiff-starched frills, large vests, and small round hats of Henry
VII.&rsquo;s time; others of the fashions of earlier periods by
distinguished painters, together with later productions of the
pencil by less famous artists, representing dogs, cattle, and
favourite horses.&nbsp; In the great hall were horns and antlers,
and other trophies of the chase, ancient guns which had done good
execution in their time, a bustard, and rare species of birds of
a like kind.&nbsp; Here and there were ancient time-pieces,
singular in construction and quaint in contrivance, one of which,
on striking the hours of noon and midnight, set in motion figures
with trumpets and various other instruments, which gave forth
their appropriate sounds.&nbsp; A great lamp&mdash;hoisted to its
place by a thick rope&mdash;lighted up that portion of the hall
into which opened the doors of the dining and other rooms, and
from which a staircase led to the gallery.</p>
<p>A meet in the neighbourhood of Willey was usually well
attended: first, because of the certainty of good sport;
secondly, because such sport was often preceded, or often
followed by receptions at the Hall, so famous for its
cheer.&nbsp; Jolly <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>were the doings on these occasions; songs were sung,
racy tales were told, old October ale flowed freely, and the
jovial merits and household virtues of Willey were fully up to
the mark of the good old times.&nbsp; The Squire usually dined
about four o&rsquo;clock, and his guests occasionally came booted
and spurred, ready for the hunt the following day, and rarely
left the festive board &rsquo;neath the hospitable roof of the
Squire until they mounted their coursers in the court-yard.</p>
<p>Dibdin, from materials gathered on the spot, has, in his own
happy manner, drawn representations of these gatherings.&nbsp;
His portraits of horses and dogs, and his description of the
social habits of the Squire and his friends are faithfully set
forth in his song of &ldquo;Bachelor&rsquo;s
Hall:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To Bachelor&rsquo;s Hall we good fellows
invite<br />
To partake of the chase which makes up our delight,<br />
We&rsquo;ve spirits like fire, and of health such a stock,<br />
That our pulse strikes the seconds as true as a clock.<br />
Did you see us you&rsquo;d swear that we mount with a grace,<br
/>
That Diana had dubb&rsquo;d some new gods of the chase.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hark away! hark away! all nature
looks gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Aurora with smiles ushers in
the bright day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick Thickset came mounted upon a fine black,<br />
A finer fleet gelding ne&rsquo;er hunter did back;<br />
<a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>Tom Trig
rode a bay full of mettle and bone,<br />
And gaily Bob Buckson rode on a roan;<br />
But the horse of all horses that rivalled the day<br />
Was the Squire&rsquo;s Neck-or-Nothing, and that was a grey.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hark away! &amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then for hounds there was Nimble who well would climb
rocks,<br />
And Cocknose a good one at finding a fox;<br />
Little Plunge, like a mole, who would ferret and search,<br />
And beetle-brow&rsquo;d Hawk&rsquo;s Eye so dead at a lurch:<br
/>
Young Sly-looks that scents the strong breeze from the south,<br
/>
And Musical Echo with his deep mouth.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hark away! &amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our horses, thus all of the very best blood,<br />
&rsquo;Tis not likely you&rsquo;d easily find such a stud;<br />
Then for foxhounds, our opinion for thousands we&rsquo;ll
back,<br />
That all England throughout can&rsquo;t produce such a pack.<br
/>
Thus having described you our dogs, horses, and crew,<br />
Away we set off, for our fox is in view.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hark away! &amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sly Reynard&rsquo;s brought home, while the horn sounds
the call,<br />
And now you&rsquo;re all welcome to Bachelor&rsquo;s Hall;<br />
The savoury sirloin gracefully smokes on the board,<br />
And Bacchus pours wine from his sacred hoard.<br />
Come on, then, do honour to this jovial place,<br />
And enjoy the sweet pleasures that have sprung from the chase.<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hark away! hark away! while our
spirits are gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us drink to the joys of next
meeting day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the occasion of Dibdin&rsquo;s visit there were at the Hall
more than the usual local notables, and Parson Stephens was
amongst them.&nbsp; As a treat intended specially for Dibdin, the
second course at <a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>dinner consisted of Severn fish, such as we no longer
have in the river.&nbsp; There were eels cooked in various ways,
flounders, perch, trout, carp, grayling, pike, and at the head of
the table that king of Severn fish, a salmon.</p>
<p><i>Dibdin</i>: &ldquo;This is a treat, Squire, and I can
readily understand now why the Severn should be called the
&lsquo;Queen of Rivers;&rsquo; it certainly deserves the
distinction for its fish, if for nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Forester</i>: &ldquo;Do you know, Dibdin, that fellow
Jessop, the engineer, set on by those Gloucester fellows, wants
to put thirteen or fourteen bars or weirs in the river between
here and Gloucester; why, it would shut out every fish worth
eating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could be his object?&rdquo; asked Dibdin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he believes, like Brindley, that rivers were made
to feed canals with, and his backers&mdash;the Gloucester
gentlemen, and the Stafford and Worcester Canal
Company&mdash;say, to make the river navigable at all seasons up
to Coalbrookdale; but my belief is that it is intended to crush
what bit of trade there yet remains on the river here, and to
give them a monopoly in the carrying trade, for our bargemen
would be taxed, whilst their carriers would be free, or nearly
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>&ldquo;We beat them, though,&rdquo; said Mr.
Pritchard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we did,&rdquo; added the Squire, &ldquo;but we had a
hard job: begad, I thought our watermen had pretty well primed me
when I went up to see Pitt on the subject; but I had not been
with him five minutes before I found he knew far more about the
river than I did:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am no orator, as Brutus is,<br />
But, as you know me all, a plain and honest
man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Several voices</i>: &ldquo;Bravo, Squire.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>To Stephens</i>: &ldquo;Will you take a
flounder?&mdash;&lsquo;flat as a flounder,&rsquo; they say.&nbsp;
I know you have a sympathy with flats, if not a liking for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Broseley colliers made a flat of him when they
dragged his own pond for the fish he was so grateful for,&rdquo;
said Hinton.</p>
<p>The laugh went against the parson, who somehow missed his
share of a venison pasty, which was a favourite of his.&nbsp; He
had been helped to a slice from a haunch which stood in the
centre of the table, and had had a cut out of a saddle of mutton
at one end, but he missed his favourite dish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true,&rdquo; inquired Dibdin, looking round at
roast, and boiled, and pasties, &ldquo;what we hear in <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>London,
that there is very considerable <i>scarcity</i> and
<i>distress</i> in the country?&rdquo;&mdash;(general
laughter).&nbsp; This brought up questions of political economy,
excess of population, stock-jobbing, usury, gentlemen taking
their money out of the country and aping Frenchified, stick-frog
fashions on their return.&nbsp; The latter was a favourite
subject with the Squire, who could not see, he said, what
amusement a gentleman could find out of the country equal to
foxhunting, and gave him an opportunity of introducing his
favourite theory of taxing heavily those who did so.&nbsp; The
discussion had lasted over the fifth course, when more potent
liquors were put upon the table, together with Broseley
pipes.&nbsp; The production of the latter was a temptation
Stephens could not resist of telling the story of the Squire
purchasing a box, for which he paid a high price, in London, and
finding, on showing them to one of his tenants, as models, that
they were made upon his own estate.&nbsp; The laugh went against
the Squire, who gave indication, by a merry twinkle in his eye,
that he would take an opportunity of being quits.&nbsp;
Discussions ensued upon the virtues and evils of tobacco, and the
refusal of Parliament to allow a census to be taken; one of the
guests expressing a belief, founded upon a statement <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>put forth
by a Dr. Price, that the population of England and Wales was
under five millions, or less, in fact, than it was in the reign
of Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Which,&rdquo; added the Squire,
&ldquo;is not correct, according to poor-law and other statistics
produced before Parliament, which show that there are from three
to four births to one death.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mr. Whitmore</i>: &ldquo;I can readily believe that this is
true in your parishes of Willey and Barrow, Forester, where a
certain person&rsquo;s amours, like Jupiter&rsquo;s, are too
numerous to mention.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Laughter, in which the Squire
joined.)</p>
<p><i>Mr. Forester</i>: &ldquo;A truce to statistics and
politics, let us have Larry Palmer, our local Incledon, in to
sing us some of Dibdin&rsquo;s songs.&rdquo;&nbsp; (General
approbation.)</p>
<p>And Larry, who was blind, and who was purposely kept in
ignorance of Dibdin being present, then gave in succession
several of what Incledon called his &ldquo;sheet-anchors,&rdquo;
including &ldquo;The Quaker,&rdquo; &ldquo;My Trim-built
Wherry,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tom Bowling,&rdquo; &amp;c., with an effect
and force which made the author exclaim that he never heard
greater justice done to his compositions, and led to an
exhibition of feeling which made the old hall ring again.</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>Dibdin&rsquo;s health was next given, with high
eulogiums as to the effect of his animating effusions on the
loyalty, valour, and patriotism which at that time blazed so
intensely in the bosom of the British tar.</p>
<p>Dibdin, in acknowledging the toast, related incidents he had
himself several times witnessed at sea; and how deeply indebted
he felt to men like Incledon and others, adding that the
inspiration which moved him was strongly in his mind from his
earliest remembrance.&nbsp; It lay, he said, a quiet hidden spark
which, for a time, found nothing hard enough to vivify it; but
which, coming in contact with proper materials, expanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Dibdin of Old Tinker,&rdquo; cried Childe, of
Kinlet.</p>
<p>The tale of Old Tinker was given, the last bit of court
scandal discussed, and some tales told of the King, with whom Mr.
Forester was on terms of friendship, and the festivities of the
evening had extended into the small hours of the morning, when,
during a brief pause in the general mirth, a tremendous crash was
heard, and the Squire rushing out to see what was the matter, met
one of the servants, who said the sound came from the larder,
whither <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>Mr. Forester repaired.&nbsp; Looking in, he saw
Stephens <i>in his shirt</i>, and, with presence of mind, he
turned the key, and went back to his company to consider how he
should turn the incident to account.</p>
<p>It appears that Stephens had been several hours in bed, when,
waking up from his first sleep, he fancied he should like a dip
into the venison pie, and forthwith had gone down into the
larder, where, in searching for the pie, he knocked down the
dish, with one or two more.&nbsp; The Squire was not long in
making up his mind how he should turn the matter to account; he
declared that it was time to retire, but before doing so, he
said, they must have a country dance, and insisted upon the whole
household being roused to take part in it.&nbsp; There was no
resisting the wishes of the host; the whole of the house
assembled, and formed sides for a dance in the hall, through
which Stephens must necessarily pass in going to his room.&nbsp;
Whilst this was taking place Mr. Forester slipped the key into
the door, and going behind Stephens, unkennelled his fox, making
the parson run the gauntlet, in his shirt, amid an indescribable
scene of merriment and confusion!</p>
<p>The very Rev. Dr. Stephens had paid for his <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>nocturnal
escapade, one would have thought, sufficiently to satisfy the
most exacting.&nbsp; But the Squire and his guests, just ripe for
fun, insisted that he should dress and come down into the
dining-room to finish the night.&nbsp; The further penalty, too,
was inflicted of making him join in the chorus of the old song,
sung with boundless approbation by one of the company,
beginning&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A parson once had a remarkable foible<br />
Of loving good liquor far more than his Bible;<br />
His neighbours all said he was much less perplext<br />
In handling a tankard than in handling a text.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Derry down,
down, down, derry down.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gist of which lies in the parson&rsquo;s reply to his
wife, who, when the pigs set his ale running, and he stormed and
swore, reminded him of his laudation of the patience of Job,
whereupon he denies the application, with the remark&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Job never had
such a cask in his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;The hunting in the
Cheviot,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>now called &ldquo;Chevy Chase,&rdquo; succeeded, and the night
closed with Dibdin singing his last new song, to music of his own
composing, with a jolly, rollicking chorus by the whole
company.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE WILLEY RECTOR, AND OTHER OF THE
SQUIRE&rsquo;S FRIENDS.</span></h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The Squire&rsquo;s Friends and the Willey
Rector more fully
drawn&mdash;Turner&mdash;Wilkinson&mdash;Harris&mdash;The Rev.
Michael Pye Stephens&mdash;His Relationship to the
Squire&mdash;In the Commission of the Peace&mdash;The Parson and
the Poacher&mdash;A Fox-hunting Christening.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Besides</span> professional sportsmen who
were wont to make the Willey roof-trees echo with their shouts,
the Squire usually assembled round his table, on Sundays, the
leading men of the neighbourhood, each of some special note or
importance in his own district, who formed at Willey a sort of
local parliament.&nbsp; Among these were brother magistrates,
tenants, and members of the clerical, legal, and medical
professions.&nbsp; Thomas Turner, a county magistrate, and the
chairman of a court of equity, to establish which the Squire
assisted him in obtaining an Act of Parliament, to whom was
dedicated a <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>sermon delivered before the justices of the peace by
the Rev. L. Booker, LL.D., was one of these.&nbsp; Mr. Turner
carried on the now famous Caughley works, where he succeeded in
producing, by means of English and French workmen, china of
superior merit, which, like the old Wedgwood productions, is now
highly prized by connoisseurs.&nbsp; He was the first producer of
the &ldquo;willow pattern,&rdquo; still so much in demand, and
his general knowledge gave him great influence.&nbsp; The Squire
paid occasional visits to his elegant chateau at Caughley, and
gave him one of the two portraits of himself which he had
painted, a picture now in possession of the widow of Mr.
Turner&rsquo;s son, George, of Scarborough, in which the Squire
is represented&mdash;as in our engraving&mdash;in his scarlet
hunting coat, with a fox&rsquo;s brush in his hand&mdash;a
facsimile of the one from which our woodcut is taken.&nbsp;
Another, but only an occasional visitor at the Hall, was John
Wilkinson, &ldquo;the Father of the Iron Trade,&rdquo; as he is
now called, who then lived at Broseley, and who was one of the
most remarkable men of the past century.&nbsp; He was for some
years a tenant of the Squire, and carried on the Willey
furnaces.&nbsp; He was also a friend of Boulton and Watt, and was
the first who succeeded <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>in boring their cylinders even all
through; he was the first, too, who taught the French the art of
boring cannon from the solid.&nbsp; He built and launched at
Willey Wharf the first iron barge&mdash;the precursor of all iron
vessels on the Thames and Tyne, and of the Great Eastern, as well
as of our modern iron-clads.&nbsp; Mr. Harries of Benthall, Mr.
Hinton of Wenlock, Mr. Bryan of The Tuckies, and Mr. John Cox
Morris, farmer of Willey, who took the first silver cup given by
the Agricultural Society of Shropshire for the best cultivated
farm, and who had still further distinguished himself in the
estimation of sportsmen by a remarkable feat of horsemanship for
a large amount, were among those who visited the Squire.</p>
<p>But a more frequent guest at the Hall and at the covert-side
was the Willey Rector, the Rev. Michael Pye Stephens, whose
family was related to that of the Welds, through the
Slaneys.&nbsp; The Rector was therefore, as already shown, on
familiar terms with the Squire, and the more so as he was able to
tell a good tale and sing a good song.&nbsp; The rural clergy a
century ago were great acquisitions at the tables of country
squires, and were not unfrequently among the most enthusiastic
lovers of the chase.&nbsp; It was by <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>no means an uncommon thing, forty
years ago, to see the horse of the late Rector of Stockton,
brother to the Squire of Apley, waiting for him at the church
door at Bonnigale, which living he also held, that he might start
immediately service was over for Melton Mowbray.&nbsp; His clerk,
too, old Littlehales, who to more secular professions added that
of village tailor, has often told how his master, being sorely in
need of a pair of hunting breeches for Melton, undertook to close
the church one Sunday in order to give him the opportunity of
making them, with the remark, &ldquo;Oh, d&mdash;n the church,
you stop at home and make the breeches.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the
Rector of Willey was by no means so enthusiastic as a
sportsman.&nbsp; He was not the</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Clerical fop, half jockey and half
clerk,<br />
The tandem-driving Tommy of a town,<br />
Disclaiming book, omniscient of a horse,<br />
Impatient till September comes again,<br />
Eloquent only of the pretty girl<br />
With whom he danced last night!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither did he resemble those more bilious members of the
profession of modern times&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who spit their puny spite on harmless
recreation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the contrary, he held what it may be difficult <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>to gainsay,
that amusements calculated to strengthen the frame and to improve
the health, if fitting for a gentleman, were not unfitting for a
clergyman.&nbsp; His presence, at any rate, was welcomed by
neighbouring squires in the field, as &ldquo;Hark in!&nbsp; Hark
in!&nbsp; Hark!&nbsp; Yoi over boys!&rdquo; sounded merrily on
the morning air; and as he sat mounted on the Squire&rsquo;s
thorough-bred it would have been difficult to have detected
anything of the divine; the clerico-waistcoat and black
single-breasted outer garment having given place to more fitting
garb.&nbsp; Fond of field sports himself, he willingly associated
with his neighbours and joined in their pastimes and
amusements.&nbsp; A man who was a frequent guest at the Hall, who
received letters from the Squire when in London, and who would
take a long pipe now and then between his lips, and moisten his
clay from a pewter tankard round a clean-scoured table in a
road-side inn, was naturally of considerable importance in his
own immediate district.</p>
<p>The Rector of Willey had, we believe, been brought up to the
legal profession, he had also a smattering knowledge of medicine,
which enabled him to render at times service to his parishioners,
who <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>called him Dr. Stephens.&nbsp; He was in the commission
of the peace, too, for the borough; and so completely did the
characters combine&mdash;so perfectly did law and divinity
dove-tail into each other&mdash;that he might have been taken as
a personification of either.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mild were his doctrines, and not one
discourse<br />
But gained in softness what it lost in force.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without stinginess he partook of the good things heaven to man
supplies; he was &ldquo;full fed;&rdquo; his face shone with
good-humour, and he was as fond of a joke as of the
Squire&rsquo;s old port.&nbsp; As a justice of the peace he was
no regarder of persons, providing they equally brought grist to
his mill; he had no objection to litigants smoothing the way to a
decision by presents, such as a piece of pork, a pork pie, or a
dish of fish; once or twice, however, he found the fish to have
been caught the previous night out of his own pond.&nbsp; Next to
a weakness for fish was one for knee-breeches and top-boots,
which in the course of much riding required frequent renewal;
and, &rsquo;tis said, that seated in his judicial chair, he has
had the satisfaction of seeing a pair of new chalked tops
projecting alike from plaintiff&rsquo;s and defendant&rsquo;s
pockets.&nbsp; In which <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>case, with spectacles raised and
head thrown back, as though to look above the petty details of
the plaint, after sundry hums and haws, with inquiries after the
crops between, and each one telling some news about his
neighbour, he would find the evidence on both sides equally
balanced and suggest a compromise!&nbsp; A good tale is told of
the justice wanting a hare for a friend, and employing a
notorious poacher to procure one.&nbsp; The man brought it in a
bag.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve brought a hare, then?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have, Mr. Stephens, and a fine one too,&rdquo; replied
the other, as he turned it out, puss flying round the room, and
over the table amongst the papers like a mad thing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Kill her! kill her!&rdquo; shouted Stephens.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, by G&mdash;,&rdquo; replied the poacher, who knew that
by doing so he would bring himself within the law, &ldquo;you
kill her; I&rsquo;ve had enough trouble to catch
her.&rdquo;&nbsp; After two or three runs the justice succeeded
in hitting her on the head with a ruler, and thus brought himself
within the power of the poacher.</p>
<p>The parson was sometimes out of temper, and then he swore, but
this was not often; still his friends were wont to joke him on
the following domestic little incident:&mdash;His services were
suddenly <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>in demand on one occasion when, a full clerical costume
being required, he found his bands not ready, and he set to work
to iron them himself.&nbsp; He was going on swimmingly as he
thought, and had only left the iron to go to the bottom of the
stairs, with a &ldquo;D&mdash;n you, madam,&rdquo; to his wife,
who had not yet come down; &ldquo;d&mdash;n you, I can do without
you,&rdquo; when, on returning, he found his bands scorched and
discoloured.</p>
<p>A foxhunter&rsquo;s christening in which the Willey Rector
played a part on one occasion is too good to lose.&nbsp; He was
the guest of Squire B&mdash;t, a well-known foxhunter, who at one
time hunted the Shifnal country with his own hounds.&nbsp; A very
jovial company from that side had assembled, and it was
determined to celebrate a new arrival in the Squire&rsquo;s
family, and to take advantage of the presence of the parson to
christen the little stranger.&nbsp; The thing was soon settled,
and Stephens proceeded in due form with the ceremony necessary to
give to the fair-haired innocent a name by which it should be
known to the world.&nbsp; The conversation of the company had of
course been upon their favourite sport, a good many bottles of
fine sherry and crusty old port had been drunk, and under their
influence, <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>it was settled that one of the company should give the
child a name in which it should be baptized, let it be what it
would.&nbsp; Stephens having taken the child in his hands, in due
form asked the name; it was given immediately as Foxhunting Moll
B&mdash;t!&nbsp; With this name the little innocent grew up, and
finally became the wife of Squire H&mdash;s; with this name she
of course signed all legal documents&mdash;first, as Foxhunting
Moll B&mdash;t, and, secondly, as Foxhunting Moll H&mdash;s.</p>

</a></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tom Moody</span> never rose above his post
of whipper-in, but he had the honour of being at the top of his
profession; and before proceeding further with our sketch of
Squire Forester it may be well to dwell for a time upon this
well-known character, whom Dibdin immortalised in his song, so
familiar to all <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>sportsmen.&nbsp; He was in fact, in many respects, what
Mr. Forester had made him: Nature supplied the material, and
Squire Forester did the rest.&nbsp; Tom had the advantage of
entering the Squire&rsquo;s service when a youth.&nbsp; Like most
boys of that period, he had been thrown a good deal upon his own
resources, a state of things not unfavourable to a development of
self-reliance, and a degree of humble heroism, such as made life
wholesome.&nbsp; Tom had no opportunities of obtaining a
national-school education, nor of carrying away the prize now
sometimes awarded to the best behaved lad in the village.&nbsp;
But in the unorganized school of common intercourse, common
suffering, and interest, was developed a pluck and daring which
led him to perform a feat on the bare back of a crop-eared cob
that gave birth to the after events of his life.&nbsp; It appears
that he was apprenticed to a Mr. Adams, a maltster, who had sent
him to deliver malt at the Hall.&nbsp; On his return he was seen
by the Squire trying his horse at a gate, and repeating the
attempt till he compelled him to leap it.&nbsp; It is said
that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He who excels in what we prize,<br />
Appears a hero in our eyes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p122.2b.jpg">
<img alt=

 src="images/p122.2s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>And
Squire Forester, struck by his pluck and perseverance, made up
his mind to secure him.&nbsp; He sent to his master to ask if he
were willing to give him up, adding that he would like to see him
at the Hall.&nbsp; The message alarmed the mother, who was a
widow, for, knowing her son&rsquo;s froward nature, she at once
imagined Tom had got into trouble.&nbsp; On learning the true
state of the case, however, and thinking she saw the way open to
Tom&rsquo;s promotion, she consented to the change in his
condition.&nbsp; His master, too, agreed to give him up, and Tom
was transferred to the Willey stables, where, from his good
nature and other agreeable qualities, he became a favourite, and
from his daring courage quite a sort of little hero.&nbsp; It was
Tom&rsquo;s duty to go on errands from the Hall, and once outside
the park, feeling he had his liberty, he did not fail to make use
of opportunities for displaying his skill.&nbsp; In riding, it
was generally up hill and down dale, at neck-or-nothing speed,
stopping neither for gate nor hedge&mdash;his horse tearing away
at a rate which would have given him three or four somersaults at
a slip.&nbsp; He seldom turned his horse&rsquo;s head if he could
help it, and if he went down he was soon up again.&nbsp;
Extraordinary tales are told <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>of Tom&rsquo;s adventures with the
Squire&rsquo;s buff-coloured chaise, in taking company from the
Hall, and in fetching visitors from Shifnal, then the nearest
place to reach a coach.&nbsp; Having a spite at a pike-keeper,
who offended him by not opening the gate quick enough, &ldquo;Tom
tanselled his hide,&rdquo; and resolved the next time he went
that way not to trouble him.&nbsp; Driving up to the gate, he
gave a spring, and touching his horse on the flanks, went
straight over without starting a stitch or breaking a
buckle.&nbsp; On another occasion he tried the same trick, but
failed; the horse went clean over, but the gig caught the top
rail, and Tom was thrown on his back.&nbsp; &ldquo;That just
sarves yo right,&rdquo; said the pike-keeper.&nbsp; &ldquo;So it
does, and now we are quits,&rdquo; added Tom; and they were
friends ever after.&nbsp; This, however, did not prevent Tom
trying it again; not that he wanted to defraud the pike-man, whom
he generally paid another time, but for &ldquo;the fun of the
thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, with his old wild favourite, with or
without the buff-coloured gig, there were no risks he was not
prepared to run.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay, ay, sir,&rdquo; said one of our
aged informants, &ldquo;you should have seen him on his horse, a
mad, wild animal no one but Tom could ride.&nbsp; He could ride
him though, with his eyes shut, <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>savage as he was, and on a good road
he would pass milestones as the clock measured minutes; but give
him the green meadows, and Lord how I have seen him whip along
the turf!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He was like a winged Mercury,
making light both of stone walls and five-feet six-inch
gates.&nbsp; He was a regular centaur, for he and his horse
seemed one,&rdquo; said another.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot tell you
the height of his horse,&rdquo; said a third, &ldquo;but he was a
big un; whilst Tom himself was a little one, and he used to be on
horse-back all day long.&nbsp; If he got into the saddle in a
morning he rarely left it till night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In giving the qualifications necessary for one aspiring to the
post of whipper-in, a well-known authority on sporting subjects
has laid it down that he should be light (not too young), with a
quick eye and still quicker ear, and that he should be&mdash;what
in fact he generally is&mdash;fond of the sport, or he seldom
succeeds in his profession.&nbsp; Now Moody, or Muddy, as his
name was pronounced, answered to these conditions.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His conversation had no other course<br />
Than that presented to his simple view<br />
Of what concerned his saddle, groom, or horse;<br />
Beyond this theme he little cared or knew:<br />
<a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>Tell him
of beauty and harmonious sounds,<br />
He&rsquo;d show his mare, and talk about his hounds.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was what was called <i>Foxy</i> all over&mdash;in his
language, dress, and associations.&nbsp; He wore a pin with a
knob, something smaller than a tea-saucer, of Caughley china,
with the head of a fox upon it; and everything nearest his
person, so far as he could manage it, had something to put him in
mind of his favourite sport.&nbsp; His bed-room walls were hung
with sporting prints, and on his mantelpiece were more
substantial trophies of the hunt&mdash;as the brush of some
remarkable victim of the pack, his boots and spurs, &amp;c.&nbsp;
His famous drinking-horn, which we have engraved together with
his trencher in the trophy at the head of this chapter, was
equally embellished with a representation of a hunt, very
elaborately carved with the point of a pen-knife.&nbsp; At the
top is a wind-mill, and below a number of horsemen and a lady,
well mounted, in full chase, and with hounds in full cry after a
fox, which is seen on the lower part of the horn.&nbsp; A
fox&rsquo;s brush forms the finis.&nbsp; The date upon the horn,
which in size and shape resembles those in use in the mansions of
the gentry in past centuries when hospitality was dispensed in
their halls with such a free and generous <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>hand, is
1663.&nbsp; It is a relic still treasured by members of the
Wheatland Hunt, who look back to the time when the shrill voice
of Moody cheered the pack over the heavy Wheatlands; and together
with his cap, of which we also give a representation, is often
made to do duty at annual social gatherings.</p>
<p>Tom was a small eight or nine stone man, with roundish face,
marked with small pox, and a pair of eyes that twinkled with good
humour.&nbsp; He possessed great strength as well as courage and
resolution, and displayed an equanimity of temper which made him
many friends.&nbsp; The huntsman was John Sewell, and under him
he performed his duties in a way so satisfactory to his master
and all who hunted with him, as to be deemed the best whipper-in
in England.&nbsp; None, it was said, could bring up the tail end
of a pack, or sustain the burst of a long chase, and be in at the
death with every hound well up, like Tom.&nbsp; His plan was to
allow his hounds their own cast without lifting, unless they
showed wildness; and if young hounds dwelt on a stale drag behind
the pack he whipped them on to those on the right line.&nbsp; He
never aspired to be more than &ldquo;a serving-man;&rdquo; he
wished, however, to be considered &ldquo;a good
whipper-in,&rdquo; and his fame as such spread through the
country.&nbsp; <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>There was not a spark of envy in his composition, and
he was one of the happiest fellows in the universe.&nbsp; The
lessons he seemed to have learnt, and which appeared to have sunk
deepest into his unsophisticated nature, were those of being
honest and of ordering himself &ldquo;lowly and reverently
towards his betters,&rdquo; for whom he had a reverence which
grew profound if they happened to have added to their
qualifications of being good sportsmen that of being
&ldquo;<i>Parliament</i> men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s voice was something extraordinary, and on one
occasion when he had fallen into an old pit shaft, which had
given way on the sides, and could not get out, it saved
him.&nbsp; His halloo to the dogs brought him assistance, and he
was extricated.&nbsp; It was capable of wonderful modulations,
and to hear him rehearse the sports of the day in the big roomy
servants&rsquo; kitchen at the Hall, and give his tally-ho, or
who-who-hoop, was considered a treat.&nbsp; On one occasion, when
Tom was in better trim than usual, the old housekeeper is said to
have remarked, &ldquo;La!&nbsp; Tom, you have given the
who-who-hoop, as you call it, so very loud and strong to-day that
you have set the cups and saucers a dancing;&rdquo; to which a
gentleman, who had purposely placed himself <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>within
hearing, replied, &ldquo;I am not at all surprised&mdash;his
voice is music itself.&nbsp; I am astonished and delighted, and
hardly know how to praise it enough.&nbsp; I never heard anything
so attractive and inspiring before in the whole course of my
life; its tones are as fine and mellow as a French
horn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Squire Forester gave up hunting, the hounds went to
Aldenham, as trencher hounds; the farmers of the district
agreeing to keep them.&nbsp; They were collected the night before
the hunt, fed after a day&rsquo;s sport, and dismissed at a crack
of the whip, each dog going off to the farm at which he was
kept.&nbsp; But it was a great trial to Tom to see them depart;
and he begged to be allowed to keep an old favourite, with which
he might often have been seen sunning himself in the yard.&nbsp;
He continued with his master from first to last, with the
exception of the short time he lived with Mr. Corbet, when the
Sundorne roof-trees were wont to ring to the toast of &ldquo;Old
Trojan,&rdquo; and when the elder Sebright was his
fellow-whip.</p>
<p>Like the old Squire, Tom never married, although, like his
master, he had a leaning towards the softer sex, and spent much
of his time in the company of his lady friends.&nbsp; One he made
his banker, and the <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>presents made to him might have
amounted to something considerable if he had taken care of
them.&nbsp; In lodging them in safe keeping he usually begged
that they might be let out to him a shilling a time; but he made
so many calls and pleaded so earnestly and availingly for more,
and was so constant a visitor at Hangster&rsquo;s Gate, that the
stock never was very large.&nbsp; Indeed he was on familiar terms
with &ldquo;Chalk Farm,&rdquo; as the score behind the ale-house
door was termed; still he never liked getting into debt, and it
was always a relief to his mind to see the sponge applied to the
score.</p>
<p>Tom was a great gun at this little way-side inn, which was
altogether a primitive institution of the kind even at that
period, but which was afterwards swept away when the present Hall
was built.&nbsp; It then stood on the old road from Bridgnorth to
Wenlock, which came winding past the Hall; and in the old
coaching days was a well-known hostelry and a favourite tippling
shop for local notables, among whom were old Scale, the Barrow
schoolmaster and parish clerk; the Cartwrights and Crumps, of
Broseley; and a few local farmers.&nbsp; One attraction was the
old coach, which called there and brought newspapers, and still
later news in <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>troubled times when battles, sieges, and the movements
of armies were the chief topics of conversation.&nbsp; Neither
coachmen nor travellers ever appeared to hurry, but would wait to
communicate the news, particularly in the pig killing season,
when a pork pie and a jug of ale would be sufficient to keep the
coach a good half hour if need be.&nbsp; We speak of course of
&ldquo;The time when George III. was king,&rdquo; before
&ldquo;His Majesty&rsquo;s Mail&rdquo; became an important
institution, and when one old man in a scarlet coat, with a face
that lost nothing by reflection therewith&mdash;excepting that a
slight tinge of purple was visible&mdash;who had many more
calling places than post offices on the road, carried pistols in
his holsters, and brought all the letters and newspapers Willey,
Wenlock, Broseley, Benthall, Ironbridge, Coalbrookdale, and some
other places then required; and these, even, took the whole day
to distribute.&nbsp; Although the lumbering old vehicle was
constantly tumbling over on going down slight declivities, it was
a great institution of the period; it was&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hurrah for the old stage coach,<br />
Be it never so worn and rusty!<br />
Hurrah for the smooth high road,<br />
Be it glaring, and scorching, and dusty!</p>
<p><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>&ldquo;Hurrah for the snug little inn,<br />
At the sign of the Plough and Harrow,<br />
And the frothy juice of the dangling hop,<br />
That tickles your spinal marrow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a great treat to travellers, who would sometimes get
off the coach and order a chaise to be sent for them from
Bridgnorth or Wenlock, to stop and listen to Tom relating the
incidents of a day&rsquo;s sport, and a still greater treat to
witness his acting, to hear his tally-ho, his who-who-hoop, or to
hear him strike up&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A southerly wind and a cloudy sky<br />
Proclaim a hunting morning.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another favourite country song just then was the following,
which has been attributed to Bishop Still, called&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">THE JUG OF ALE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was sitting one afternoon<br />
Of a pleasant day in the month of June,<br />
I heard a thrush sing down the vale,<br />
And the tune he sang was &lsquo;the jug of ale,&rsquo;<br />
And the tune he sang was the jug of ale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white sheet bleaches on the hedge,<br />
And it sets my wisdom teeth on edge,<br />
When dry with telling your pedlar&rsquo;s tale,<br />
Your only comfort&rsquo;s a jug of ale,<br />
Your only comfort&rsquo;s a jug of ale.</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>&ldquo;I jog along the footpath way,<br />
For a merry heart goes all the day;<br />
But at night, whoever may flout and rail,<br />
I sit down with my friend, the jug of ale,<br />
With my good old friend, the jug of ale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether the sweet or sour of the year,<br />
I tramp and tramp though the gallows be near.<br />
Oh, while I&rsquo;ve a shilling I will not fail<br />
To drown my cares in a jug of ale,<br />
Drown my cares in a jug of ale!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which old Amen, as the parish clerk was called, in order to
be orthodox, would add from the same convivial prelate&rsquo;s
farce-comedy of &ldquo;Gammer Gurton&rsquo;s
Needle:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I cannot eat but little meat<br />
My stomach is not good;<br />
But sure I think that I can drink<br />
With him that wears a hood.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A pleasant cheerful glass or two, Tom was wont to say, would
hurt nobody, and he could toss off a horn or two of
&ldquo;October&rdquo; without moving a muscle or winking an
eye.&nbsp; His constitution was as sound as a roach; and whilst
he could get up early and sniff the fragrant gale, they did not
appear to tell.&nbsp; But he had a spark in his throat, as he
said, and he indulged in such frequent libations to extinguish
it, that, towards the end of the year 1796, he <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>was well
nigh worn out.&nbsp; After a while, finding himself becoming
weak, and feeling that his end was approaching, he expressed a
desire to see his old master, who at once gratified the wish of
the sufferer, and, without thinking that his end was so near,
inquired what he wanted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Tom,
&ldquo;one request to make, and it is the last favour I shall
crave.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Squire,
&ldquo;what is it, Tom?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My time here
won&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo; Tom added; &ldquo;and when I am dead
I wish to be buried at Barrow, under the yew tree, in the
churchyard there, and to be carried to the grave by six
earth-stoppers; my old horse, with my whip, boots, spurs, and
cap, slung on each side of the saddle, and the brush of the last
fox when I was up at the death, at the side of the forelock, and
two couples of old hounds to follow me to the grave as
mourners.&nbsp; When I am laid in the grave let three halloos be
given over me; and then, if I don&rsquo;t lift up my head, you
may fairly conclude that Tom Moody&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
old whipper-in expired shortly afterwards, and his request was
carried out to the letter, as the following characteristic letter
from the Squire to his friend Chambers, describing the
circumstances, will show:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Chambers</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Tuesday last died poor Tom Moody, as good for rough
and smooth as ever entered Wildmans Wood.&nbsp; He died brave and
honest, as he lived&mdash;beloved by all, hated by none that ever
knew him.&nbsp; I took his own orders as to his will, funeral,
and every other thing that could be thought of.&nbsp; He died
sensible and fully collected as ever man died&mdash;in short,
died game to the last; for when he could hardly swallow, the poor
old lad took the farewell glass for success to fox-bunting, and
his poor old master (as he termed it), for ever.&nbsp; I am sole
executor, and the bulk of his fortune he left to
me&mdash;six-and-twenty shillings, real and <i>bon&acirc;
fide</i> sterling cash, free from all incumbrance, after every
debt discharged to a farthing.&nbsp; Noble deeds for Tom,
you&rsquo;d say.&nbsp; The poor old ladies at the Ring of Bells
are to have a knot each in remembrance of the poor old lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salop paper will show the whole ceremony of his burial,
but for fear you should not see that paper, I send it to you, as
under:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sportsmen, attend.&mdash;On Tuesday, 29th inst.,
was buried at Barrow, near Wenlock, Salop, Thomas <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>Moody, the
well-known whipper-in to G. Forester, Esq.&rsquo;s fox-hounds for
twenty years.&nbsp; He was carried to the grave by a proper
number of earth-stoppers, and attended by many other sporting
friends, who heartily mourned for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Directly after the corpse followed his old favourite
horse (which he always called his &lsquo;Old Soul&rsquo;), thus
accoutred: carrying his last fox&rsquo;s brush in the front of
his bridle, with his cap, whip, boots, spurs, and girdle, across
his saddle.&nbsp; The ceremony being over, he (by his own
desire), had three clear rattling view haloos o&rsquo;er his
grave; and thus ended the career of poor Tom, who lived and died
an honest fellow, but alas! a very wet one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you and your family are well, and you&rsquo;ll
believe me, much yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;G. <span
class="smcap">Forester</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Willey</span>, Dec. 5,
1796.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need add nothing to the description the Squire gave of the
way in which Tom&rsquo;s last wishes were carried out, and shall
merely remark that the old fellow kept on his livery to the last,
and that he died in his boots, which were for some time kept as
relics&mdash;a circumstance which leads us to <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>appropriate
the following lines, which appeared a few years ago in the
<i>Sporting Magazine</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You have ofttimes indulged in a sneer<br />
At the old pair of boots I&rsquo;ve kept year after year,<br />
And I promised to tell you (when &lsquo;funning&rsquo; last
night)<br />
The reasons I have thus to keep them in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those boots were Tom Moody&rsquo;s (a better
ne&rsquo;er strode<br />
A hunter or hack, in the field&mdash;on the road&mdash;<br />
None more true to his friend, or his bottle when full,<br />
In short, you may call him a thorough John Bull).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now this world you must own&rsquo;s a strange compound
of fate,<br />
(A kind of tee-to-turn resembling of late)<br />
Where hope promised joy <i>there</i> will sorrow be found,<br />
And the vessel best trimm&rsquo;d is oft soonest aground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come in for my share of
&lsquo;Take-up&rsquo; and &lsquo;Put-down,&rsquo;<br />
And that rogue, Disappointment, oft makes me look brown,<br />
And then (you may sneer and look wise if you will)<br />
From those old pair of boots I can comfort distil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I but cast my eyes on them and old Willey Hall<br />
Is before me again, with its ivy-crown&rsquo;d wall,<br />
Its brook of soft murmurs&mdash;its rook-laden trees,<br />
The gilt vane on its dovecot swung round by the breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see its old owner descend from the door,<br />
I feel his warm grasp as I felt it of yore;<br />
Whilst old servants crowd round&mdash;as they once us&rsquo;d to
do,<br />
And their old smiles of welcome beam on me anew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in the old bedroom that looks on the lawn,<br />
The old cock is crowing to herald the dawn;<br />
<a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>There!
old Jerry is rapping, and hark how he hoots,<br />
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis past five o&rsquo;clock, Tom, and here are your

<p>&ldquo;I am in the old homestead, and here comes &lsquo;old
Jack,&rsquo;<br />
And old Stephens has help&rsquo;d Master George to his back;<br

Whilst old <i>Childers</i>, old <i>Pilot</i>, and little
<i>Blue-boar</i><br />
Lead the merry-tongued hounds through the old kennel door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m by the old wood, and I hear the old

&lsquo;Od&rsquo;s rat ye dogs&mdash;wind him!&nbsp; Hi!&nbsp;
Nimble, lad, hi!&rsquo;<br />
I see the old fox steal away through the gap,<br />
Whilst old Jack cheers the hounds with his old velvet cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m seated again by my old grandad&rsquo;s
chair,<br />
Around me old friends and before me old fare;<br />
Every guest is a sportsman, and scarlet his suit,<br />
And each leg &rsquo;neath the table is cas&rsquo;d in a boot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear the old toasts and the old songs again,<br />
&lsquo;<i>Old Maiden</i>&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Tom

I drink the old wine, and I hear the old call&mdash;<br />

<span class="GutSmall">SUCCESS OF THE SONG.</span></h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Dibdin&rsquo;s Song&mdash;Dibdin and the
Squire good fellows well met&mdash;Moody a Character after
Dibdin&rsquo;s own heart&mdash;The Squire&rsquo;s
Gift&mdash;Incledon&mdash;The Shropshire Fox-hunters on the Stage
at Drury Lane.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reader will have perceived that
George Forester and Charles Dibdin were good fellows well met,
and that no two men were ever better fitted to appreciate each
other.&nbsp; Like the popular monarch of the time, each prided
himself upon being a Briton; each admired every new
distinguishing trait of nationality, and gloried in any special
development of national pluck and daring.&nbsp; No one more than
Mr. Forester was ready to endorse that charming bit of history
Dibdin gave of his native land in his song of &ldquo;The snug
little Island,&rdquo; or would join more heartily in the
chorus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Search the globe round, none can be
found<br />
So happy as this little island.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p140b.jpg">

</a></p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>No
one could have done its geography or have painted the features of
its inhabitants in fewer words or stronger colours.&nbsp; We use
the word stronger rather than brighter, remembering that Dibdin
drew his heroes redolent of tar, of rum, and tobacco.&nbsp; He
had the knack of seizing upon broad national characteristics,
and, like a true artist, of bringing them prominently into the
foreground by means of such simple accessories as seemed to give
them force and effect.</p>
<p>In the Willey whipper-in Dibdin found the same unsophisticated
bit of primitive nature cropping up which he so successfully
brought out in his portraits of salt-water heroes; he found the
same spirit differently manifested; for had Moody served in the
cock-pit, the gun-room, on deck, or at the windlass, he would
have been a &ldquo;Ben Backstay&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Poor
Jack&rdquo;&mdash;from that singleness of aim and daring which
actuated him.&nbsp; How clearly Dibdin set forth this sentiment
in that stanza of the song of &ldquo;Poor Jack,&rdquo; in which
the sailor, commenting upon the sermon of the chaplain, draws
this conclusion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye mind me, a sailor should be,
every inch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All as one as a piece of a ship;<br />
And, with her, brave the world without off&rsquo;ring to
flinch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the moment the anchor&rsquo;s a-trip.<br />
<a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>As to
me, in all weathers, all times, tides, and ends,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nought&rsquo;s a trouble from duty that springs;<br
/>
My heart is my Poll&rsquo;s, and my rhino my friend&rsquo;s,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And as for my life, &rsquo;tis my
King&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The country was indebted to this faculty of rhyming for much
of that daring and devotion to its interests which distinguished
soldiers and sailors at that remarkable period.&nbsp;
Dibdin&rsquo;s songs, as he, with pride, was wont to say, were
&ldquo;the solace of sailors on long voyages, in storms, and in
battles.&rdquo;&nbsp; His &ldquo;Tom Moody&rdquo; illustrated the
same pluck and daring which under the vicissitudes and
peculiarities of the times&mdash;had it been Tom&rsquo;s fortune
to have served under Drake or Blake, Howe, Jervis, or
Nelson&mdash;would equally have supplied materials for a
stave.</p>
<p>From the letter of the Squire the reader will see how
truthfully the great English Beranger, as he has been called,
adhered to the circumstances in his song:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You all knew Tom Moody, the whipper-in,
well.<br />
The bell that&rsquo;s done tolling was honest Tom&rsquo;s
knell;<br />
A more able sportsman ne&rsquo;er followed a hound<br />
Through a country well known to him fifty miles round.<br />
No hound ever open&rsquo;d with Tom near a wood,<br />
But he&rsquo;d challenge the tone, and could tell if it were
good;<br />
And all with attention would eagerly mark,<br />
When he cheer&rsquo;d up the pack, &lsquo;Hark! to Rockwood,
hark! hark!<br />
Hie!&mdash;wind him! and cross him!&nbsp; Now, Rattler,
boy!&nbsp; Hark!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>&ldquo;Six crafty earth-stoppers, in hunter&rsquo;s
green drest,<br />
Supported poor Tom to an earth made for rest.<br />
His horse, which he styled his &lsquo;Old Soul,&rsquo; next
appear&rsquo;d,<br />
On whose forehead the brush of his last fox was rear&rsquo;d:<br
/>
Whip, cap, boots, and spurs, in a trophy were bound,<br />
And here and there followed an old straggling hound.<br />
Ah! no more at his voice yonder vales will they trace!<br />
Nor the welkin resound his burst in the chase!<br />
With high over!&nbsp; Now press him!&nbsp; Tally-ho!&nbsp;
Tally-ho!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus Tom spoke his friends ere he gave up his
breath:<br />
&lsquo;Since I see you&rsquo;re resolved to be in at the
death,<br />
One favour bestow&mdash;&rsquo;tis the last I shall crave,<br />
Give a rattling view-halloo thrice over my grave;<br />
And unless at that warning I lift up my head,<br />
My boys, you may fairly conclude I am dead!&rsquo;<br />
Honest Tom was obeyed, and the shout rent the sky,<br />
For every one joined in the tally-ho cry!<br />
Tally-ho!&nbsp; Hark forward!&nbsp; Tally-ho!&nbsp;
Tally-ho!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On leaving Willey, Mr. Forester asked Dibdin what he could do
to discharge the obligation he felt himself under for his
services; the great ballad writer, whom Pitt pensioned, replied
&ldquo;Nothing;&rdquo; he had been so well treated that he could
not accept anything.&nbsp; Finding artifice necessary, Mr.
Forester asked him if he would deliver a letter for him
personally at his banker&rsquo;s on his arrival in London.&nbsp;
Of course Dibdin consented, and on doing so he found it was an
order to pay him &pound;100!</p>
<p>When the song first came out Charles Incledon, <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>by the
&ldquo;human voice divine,&rdquo; was drawing vast audiences at
Drury Lane Theatre.&nbsp; On play-bills, in largest type, forming
the most attractive morceaux of the bill of fare, this song,
varied by others of Dibdin&rsquo;s composing, would be seen; and
when he was first announced to sing it, a few fox-hunting friends
of the Squire went to London to hear it.&nbsp; Taking up their
positions in the pit, they were all attention as the inimitable
singer rolled out, with that full volume of voice which at once
delighted and astounded his audience, the verse
commencing:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You all knew Tom Moody the whipper-in
well.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the great singer did not succeed to the satisfaction of
the small knot of Shropshire fox-hunters in the &ldquo;tally-ho
chorus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Detecting the technical defect which
practical experience in the field alone could supply, they jumped
upon the stage, and gave the audience a specimen of what
Shropshire lungs could do.</p>
<p>The song soon became popular.&nbsp; It seized at once upon the
sporting mind, and upon the mind of the country generally.&nbsp;
The London publishers took it up, and gave it with the music,
together with woodcuts and lithographic illustrations, and it
soon found <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>a ready sale.&nbsp; But the illustrations were
untruthful.&nbsp; The church was altogether a fancy sketch,
exceedingly unlike the quaint old simple structure still
standing.&nbsp; A print published by Wolstenholme, in 1832,
contains a very faithful representation of the church on the
northern side, with the grave, and a large gathering of sportsmen
and spectators, at the moment the &ldquo;view halloo&rdquo; is
supposed to have been given.&nbsp; It is altogether spiritedly
drawn and well coloured, and makes a pleasing subject; but the
view is taken on the wrong side of the church, the artist having
evidently chosen this, the northern side, because of the distance
and middle distance, and in order to make a taking picture.&nbsp;
The view has this advantage, however, it shows the Clee Hills in
the distance.&nbsp; Tom&rsquo;s grave is covered by a simple
slab, containing the following inscription,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">TOM MOODY,<br />
<span class="smcap">Buried Nov</span>. 19<span
class="smcap">th</span>, 1796,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and is on the opposite side, near the old porch, and chief
entrance to the church.</p>
<p>In the full-page engraving, representing a meet near
&ldquo;Hangster&rsquo;s Gate,&rdquo; a famous
&ldquo;fixture&rdquo; in the old Squire&rsquo;s time, the
assembled sportsmen are <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>supposed to be startled by the
re-appearance of Tom upon the ground of his former
exploits.&nbsp; It is the belief of some that when a corpse is
laid in the grave an angel gives notice of the coming of two
examiners.&nbsp; The dead person is then made to undergo the
ordeal before two spirits of terrible appearance.&nbsp; Whether
this was the faith of Tom&rsquo;s friends or not we cannot say,
but Tom was supposed to have been anything but satisfied with his
quarters or his company, and to have returned to visit the Willey
Woods.&nbsp; The picture presents a group of sportsmen and hounds
beneath the trees, and attention is directed towards the spectre,
an old decayed stump.&nbsp; The following lines refer to the
tradition:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;See the shade of Tom Moody, you all have
known well,<br />
To our sports now returning, not liking to dwell<br />
In a region where pleasure&rsquo;s not found in the chase,<br />
So Tom&rsquo;s just returned to view his old place.<br />
No sooner the hounds leave the kennel to try,<br />
Than his spirit appears to join in the cry;<br />
Now all with attention, his signal well mark,<br />
For see his hand&rsquo;s up for the cry of Hark! Hark!<br />
Then cheer him, and mark him, Tally-ho! Boys!
Tally-ho!&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE WILLEY SQUIRE MEMBER FOR
WENLOCK.</span></h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The Willey Squire recognises the Duties of his
Position, and becomes Member for Wenlock&mdash;Addison&rsquo;s
View of Whig Jockeys and Tory Fox-hunters&mdash;State of
Parties&mdash;Pitt in
Power&mdash;&ldquo;Fiddle-Faddle&rdquo;&mdash;Local
Improvements&mdash;The Squire Mayor of Wenlock&mdash;The Mace now
carried before the Chief Magistrate.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is an old English maxim that
&ldquo;too much of anything is good for nothing;&rdquo; the
obvious meaning being that a man should not addict himself over
much to any one pursuit; and it is only justice to the Willey
Squire that it should be fully understood <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>that whilst
passionately fond of the pleasures of the chase, he was not
unmindful of the duties of his position.&nbsp; Willey was the
centre of the sporting country we have described; but it was also
contiguous to a district remarkable for its manufacturing
activity&mdash;for its iron works, its pot works, and its brick
works, the proprietors of which, no less than the agricultural
portion of the population, felt that they had an interest in
questions of legislation.&nbsp; Mr. Forester considered that
whatever concerned his neighbourhood and his country concerned
him, and his influence and popularity in the borough led to his
taking upon himself the duty of representing it in
Parliament.&nbsp; There was about the temper of the times
something more suited to the temperament of a country gentleman
than at present, and a member of Parliament was less bound to his
constituents.&nbsp; His duties as a representative sat much more
lightly, whilst the pugnacious elements of the nation generally
were such that when Mr. Forester entered upon public life there
was nearly as much excitement in the House of Commons&mdash;and
not unlike in kind&mdash;as was to be found in the cockpit or the
hunting-field.</p>
<p>As long as Mr. Forester could remember, parties <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>had been as
sharply defined as at present, and men were as industriously
taught to believe that whatever ranged itself under one form of
faith was praiseworthy, whilst everything on the other side was
to be condemned.&nbsp; Addison, in his usually happy style, had
already described this state of things in the <i>Spectator</i>,
where he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This humour fills the country with several
periodical meetings of Whig jockeys and Tory fox-hunters; not to
mention the innumerable curses, frowns, and whispers it produces
at a quarter sessions. . . .&nbsp; In all our journey from London
to this house we did not so much as bait at a Whig inn; or if by
chance the coachman stopped at a wrong place, one of Sir
Roger&rsquo;s servants would ride up to his master full speed,
and whisper to him that the master of the house was against such
an one in the last election.&nbsp; This often betrayed us into
hard beds and bad cheer, for we were not so inquisitive about the
inn as the innkeeper; and, provided our landlord&rsquo;s
principles were sound, did not take any notice of the staleness
of the provisions.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that Whig and Tory had even then long been names
representing those principles by which the Constitution was
balanced, names representing those <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>popular and monarchical ingredients
which it was supposed assured liberty and order, progress and
stability.&nbsp; But about the commencement of Mr.
Forester&rsquo;s parliamentary career parties had been in a great
measure broken up into sections, if not into factions&mdash;into
Pelhamites, Cobhamites, Foxites, Pittites, and Wilkites&mdash;the
questions uppermost being place, power, and distinction, ministry
and opposition&mdash;the Ins and the Outs.&nbsp; The Ins, when
Whigs, pretty much as now, adopted Tory principles, and Tories in
opposition appealed to popular favour for support; indeed from
the fall of Walpole to the American war, as now, there were few
statesmen who were not by turns the colleagues and the
adversaries, the friends and the foes of their
contemporaries.&nbsp; The general pulse, it is true, beat more
feverishly, and men went to Parliament or into battle as readily
as to the hunting-field&mdash;for the excitement of the
thing.&nbsp; To epitomise, mighty armies, such as Europe had not
seen since the days of Marlborough, were moving in every
direction.&nbsp; Four hundred and fifty-two thousand men were
gathering to crush the Prince of a German state, with one hundred
and fifty thousand men in the field to encounter them.&nbsp; The
English and Hanoverian <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>army, under the Duke of Cumberland,
was relied upon to prevent the French attacking Prussia, with
whom we had formed an alliance.&nbsp; England felt an intense
interest in the struggle, and bets were made as to the
result.&nbsp; Mr. Forester was returned to the new Parliament,
which met in December, 1757, in time, we believe, to vote for the
subsidy of &pound;670,000 asked for by the king for his
&ldquo;good brother and ally,&rdquo; the King of Prussia.&nbsp; A
minister like Pitt, who was then inspiring the people with his
spirit, and raising the martial ardour of the nation to a pitch
it had never known before, who drew such pictures of
England&rsquo;s power and pluck as to cause the French envoy to
jump out of the window, was a man after the Squire&rsquo;s own
heart, and he gave him his hearty &ldquo;aye,&rdquo; to subsidy
after subsidy.&nbsp; As a contemporary satirist wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No more they make a fiddle-faddle<br />
About a Hessian horse or saddle.<br />
No more of continental measures;<br />
No more of wasting British treasures.<br />
Ten millions, and a vote of credit.<br />
&rsquo;Tis right.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t be wrong who did
it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Forester gave way to Cecil Forester, a few <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>months
prior to the marriage of the King to the Princess Charlotte; but
was returned again, in 1768, with Sir Henry Bridgeman, and sat
till 1774, during what has been called the &ldquo;Unreported
Parliament.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was returned in October of the same
year with the same gentleman.&nbsp; He was also returned to the
new Parliament in 1780, succeeding Mr. Whitmore, who, having been
returned for Wenlock and Bridgnorth, elected to sit for the
latter; and he sat till 1784.&nbsp; Sir H. Bridgeman and John
Simpson, Esq., were then returned, and sat till the following
year; when Mr. Simpson accepted the Chiltern Hundreds, and Mr.
Forester, being again solicited to represent the interests of the
borough, was returned, and continued to sit until the sixteenth
Parliament of Great Britain, having nearly completed its full
term of seven years, was dissolved, soon after its prorogation in
June, 1790.</p>

<p>It is not our intention to comment upon the votes given by the
Squire in his place in Parliament during the thirty years he sat
in the House; suffice it to say, that we believe he gave an
honest support to measures which came before the country, and
that he was neither bought nor bribed, as many members of that
period were.&nbsp; He was active in <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>getting the sanction of Parliament
for local improvements, for the construction of a towing-path
along the Severn, and for the present handsome iron
bridge&mdash;the first of its kind&mdash;over it, to connect the
districts of Broseley and Madeley.&nbsp; On retiring from the
office of chief magistrate of the borough, which he filled for
some years, he presented to the corporation the handsome mace now
in use, which bears the following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The gift of George Forester of Willey,
Esq., to the Bailiff, Burgesses, and Commonalty of the Borough of
Wenlock, as a token of his high esteem and regard for the
attachment and respect they manifested towards him during the
many years he represented the borough in Parliament, and served
the office of Chief Magistrate and Justice thereof.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> fancy there was a greater
community of feeling in Squire Forester&rsquo;s day than now, and
that whether indulging in sport or in doing earnest work, men
acted more together.&nbsp; Differences of wealth caused less
differences of caste, of speech, and of habit; men of different
classes saw more of each other and were more together;
consequently there was more cohesion of the particles of which
society is composed, and, if the term be admissible, the several
grades were more interpenetrated by agencies which served to make
them one.&nbsp; Gentlemen <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>were content with the good old
English sports and pastimes of the period, and these caused them
to live on their own estates, surrounded by and in the presence
of those whom modern refinements serve to separate; and their
dependants therefore were more alive to those reciprocal,
neighbourly, and social duties out of which patriotism
springs.&nbsp; They might not have been better or wiser, but they
appear to have approached nearer to that state of society when
every citizen considered himself to be so closely identified with
the nation as to feel bound to bear arms against an invading
enemy, and, as far as possible, to avert a danger.&nbsp; Never
was the rivalry of England and France more vehement.&nbsp;
Emboldened by successes, the French began to think themselves all
but invincible, and burned to meet in mortal combat their ancient
enemies, whilst our countrymen, equally defiant, and with
recollections of former glory, sought no less an opportunity of
measuring their strength with the veteran armies of their
rivals.&nbsp; The embers of former passions yet lay smouldering
when the French Minister of Marine talked of making a descent on
England, and of destroying the Government; a threat calculated to
influence the feelings of old sportsmen like Squire Forester, who
nourished a love of country, whose <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>souls throbbed with the same
national feeling, and who were equally ready to respond to a call
to maintain the sacredness of their homes, or to risk their lives
in their defence.&nbsp; Oneyers and Moneyers&mdash;men
&ldquo;whose words upon &rsquo;change would go much further than
their blows in battle,&rdquo; as Falstaff says, came forward, if
for nothing else, as examples to others.&nbsp; On both banks of
the Severn men looked upon the Squire as a sort of local centre,
and as the head of a district, as a leader whom they would
follow&mdash;as one old tradesman said&mdash;to hell, if
necessary.&nbsp; A general meeting was called at the Guildhall,
Wenlock, and a still more enthusiastic gathering took place at
Willey.&nbsp; Mr. Forester never did things by halves, and what
he did he did at once.&nbsp; He was not much at speech-making,
but he had that ready wit and happy knack of going to the point
and hitting the nail on the head in good round Saxon, that told
amazingly with his old foxhunting friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know very well
that I have retired from the representation of the borough.&nbsp;
I did so in the belief that I had discharged, as long as need be,
those public duties I owe to my neighbours; and in the hope that
I <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>should
be permitted henceforth to enjoy the pleasures of
retirement.&nbsp; I parted with my hounds, and gave up hunting;
but here I am, continually on horseback, hunting up men all round
the Wrekin!&nbsp; The movement is general, and differences of
feeling are subsiding into one for the defence of the
nation.&nbsp; Whigs and Tories stand together in the ranks; and
as I told the Lord-Lieutenant the other day, we must have not
less than four or five thousand men in uniform, equipped, every
Jack-rag of &rsquo;em, without a farthing cost to the
country.&nbsp; (Applause.)&nbsp; There are some dastardly devils
who run with the hare, but hang with the hounds, damn &rsquo;em
(laughter); whose patriotism, by G&mdash;d, hangs by such a small
strand that I believe the first success of the enemies of the
country would sever it.&nbsp; They are a lot of damnation
Jacobins, all of &rsquo;em, whining black-hearted devils, with
distorted intellects, who profess to perceive no danger.&nbsp;
And, by G&mdash;d, the more plain it is, the less they see
it.&nbsp; It is, as I say, put an owl into daylight, stick a
candle on each side of him, and the more light the poor devil has
the less he sees.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Cries of &ldquo;Bravo, hurrah for
the Squire.&rdquo;)&nbsp; In conclusion he called upon the
lawyer, the ironmaster, the pot maker, the artisan, and the
labourer <a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>to drill, and prepare for defending their hearths and
homes; they had property to defend, shops that might be
plundered, houses that might be burned, or children to save from
being brained, and wives or daughters to protect from treatment
which sometimes prevailed in time of war.</p>
<p>As a result of his exertions, a strong and efficient company
was formed, called &ldquo;The Wenlock Loyal
Volunteers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Squire was major, and he spared
neither money nor trouble in rendering it efficient.&nbsp; He
always gave the members a dinner on the 4th of June, the birthday
of George III., who had won his admiration and devotion by his
boldness as a fox-hunter, no less than by his daring proposal,
during the riots of 1780, to ride at the head of his guards into
the midst of the fires of the capital.&nbsp; On New Year&rsquo;s
Day, that being the birthday of Major Forester, the officers and
men invariably dined together in honour of their commander.&nbsp;
The corps were disbanded, we believe, in 1802, for we find in a
cutting from a Shrewsbury paper of the 12th of January, 1803,
that about that time a subscription was entered into for the
purchase of a handsome punch-bowl.&nbsp; The newspaper states
that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On New Year&rsquo;s Day, 1803, the members
of the late corps of <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>Wenlock Loyal Volunteers, commanded
by Major Forester, dined at the Raven Inn, Much Wenlock, in
honour of their much-respected major&rsquo;s birthday, when the
evening was spent with that cheerful hilarity and orderly conduct
which always characterised this respectable corps, when embodied
for the service of their king and country.&nbsp; In the morning
of the day the officers, deputed by the whole corps, waited on
the Major, at Willey, and presented him, in an appropriate
speech, with a most elegant bowl, of one hundred guineas value,
engraved with his arms, and the following inscription, which the
Major was pleased to accept, and returned a suitable
answer:&mdash;&lsquo;To George Forester, of Willey, Esq., Major
Commandant of the Wenlock Loyal Volunteers, for his sedulous
attention and unbounded liberality to his corps, raised and
disciplined under his command without any expense to Government,
and rendered essentially serviceable during times of
unprecedented difficulty and danger; this humble token of their
gratitude and esteem is most respectfully presented to him by his
truly faithful and very obedient servants,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;&lsquo;<span
class="smcap">The Wenlock Volunteers</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Major Forester.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>The
following reply appeared in the same paper the succeeding
week:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Major Forester, seeing an account in the
Shrewsbury papers relative to the business which occurred at
Willey upon New Year&rsquo;s Day last, between him and his late
corps of Wenlock Volunteers, presumes to trouble the public eye
with his answer thereto, thinking it an unbounded duty of
gratitude and respect owing to his late corps, to return them (as
their late commander) his most explicit public thanks, as well as
his most grateful and most sincere acknowledgments, for the high
honour lately conferred upon him, by their kind present of a
silver bowl, value one hundred guineas.&nbsp; Major
Forester&rsquo;s unwearied attention, as well as his liberality
to his late corps, were ever looked upon by him as a part of his
duty, in order to make some compensation to a body of
distinguished respectable yeomanry, who had so much the interest
and welfare of him and their country at heart, that he plainly
perceived himself, and so must every other intelligent spectator
on the ground at the time of exercise, that they only waited
impatiently for the word to put the order into execution
directly; but with such <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>regularity as their commander
required and ever had cheerfully granted to him.&nbsp; A return
of mutual regard between the major and his late corps was all he
wished for, and he is now more fully convinced, by this public
mark of favour, of their real esteem and steady friendship.&nbsp;
He therefore hopes they will (to a man) give him credit when he
not only assures them of his future constant sincerity and
unabated affection, but further take his word when he likewise
promises them that his gratitude and faithful remembrance of the
Wenlock Loyal Volunteers shall never cease but with the last
period of his worldly existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Willey</span>, 12th Jan.,
1803.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon after the first corps of volunteers was disbanded, the
Squire was entertaining his guests with the toast&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God save the king, and bless the land<br />
In plenty, song, and peace;<br />
And grant henceforth that foul debates<br />
&rsquo;Twixt noblemen may cease&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when he received a letter from London, stating that at an
audience given to Cornwallis, the First Consul was very gracious;
that he inquired <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>after the health of the king, and &ldquo;spoke of the
British nation in terms of great respect, intimating that as long
as they remained friends there would be no interruption to the
peace of Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the guests added&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;And that I
think&rsquo;s a reason fair to drink and fill again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was clear to all, however, who looked beneath the surface,
that the peace was a hollow truce, and that good grounds existed
for timidity, if not for fear, respecting a descent upon our
shores:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Sometimes the
vulgar see and judge aright.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Month by month, week by week, clouds were gathering upon a sky
which the Peace of Amiens failed to clear.</p>
<p>The First Consul declared against English commerce, and
preparations on a gigantic scale were being made by the
construction of vessels on the opposite shores of the Channel for
invasion.</p>
<p>The public spirit in France was invoked; the spirit of this
country was also aroused, and vigorous efforts were made by
Parliament and the people to maintain the inviolability of our
shores.&nbsp; Newspaper denunciations excited the ire of the
First <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>Consul, who demanded of the English Government that it
should restrict their power.&nbsp; A recriminatory war of words,
of loud and fierce defiances, influenced the temper of the people
on each side of the Channel, and it again became evident that
differences existed which could only be settled by the
sword.&nbsp; In a conversation with Lord Whitworth, Napoleon was
reported to have said:&mdash;&ldquo;A descent upon your coasts is
the only means of offence I possess; and that I am determined to
attempt, and to put myself at its head.&nbsp; But can you suppose
that, after having gained the height on which I stand, I would
risk my life and reputation in so hazardous an undertaking,
unless compelled to it by absolute necessity.&nbsp; I know that
the probability is that I myself, and the greatest part of the
expedition, will go to the bottom.&nbsp; There are a hundred
chances to one against me; but I am determined to make the
attempt; and such is the disposition of the troops that army
after army will be found ready to engage in the
enterprise.&rdquo;&nbsp; This conversation took place on the 21st
of February, 1803; and such were the energetic measures taken by
the English Government and people, that on the 25th of March,
independent of the militia, 80,000 strong, which were <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>called out
at that date, and the regular army of 130,000 already voted, the
House of Commons, on June 28th, agreed to the very unusual step
of raising 50,000 men additional, by drafting, in the proportion
of 34,000 for England, 10,000 for Ireland, and 6,000 for
Scotland, which it was calculated would raise the regular troops
in Great Britain to 112,000 men, besides a large surplus force
for offensive operations.&nbsp; In addition to this a bill was
brought in shortly afterwards to enable the king to call out the
levy <i>en masse</i> to repel the invasion of the enemy, and
empowering the lord-lieutenants of the several counties to enrol
all the men in the kingdom, between seventeen and fifty-five
years of age, to be divided into regiments according to their
several ages and professions: those persons to be exempt who were
members of any volunteer corps approved of by his Majesty.&nbsp;
Such was the state of public feeling generally that the king was
enabled to review, in Hyde Park, sixty battalions of volunteers,
127,000 men, besides cavalry, all equipped at their own
expense.&nbsp; The population of the country at the time was but
a little over ten millions, about a third of what it is at
present; yet such was the zeal and enthusiasm that in a few weeks
300,000 men <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>were enrolled, armed, and disciplined, in the different
parts of the kingdom.</p>
<p>The movement embraced all classes and professions.&nbsp; It
was successful in providing a powerful reserve of trained men to
strengthen the ranks and to supply the vacancies of the regular
army, thus contributing in a remarkable manner to produce a
patriotic ardour and feeling among the people, and laying the
foundation of that spirit which enabled Great Britain at length
to appear as principal in the contest, and to beat down the power
of France, even where hitherto she had obtained unexampled
success.</p>
<p>Thus, after the first Wenlock Loyal Volunteers were disbanded,
Squire Forester found but little respite; he and the Willey
fox-hunters again felt it their duty to come forward and enroll
themselves in the Second Wenlock Royal Volunteers.</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Design
whate&rsquo;er we will,<br />
There is a fate which overrules us still.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No man was better fitted to undertake the task; no one knew
better how</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By winning words to conquer willing
hearts,<br />
And make persuasion do the work of fear.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>And,
mainly through his exertions, an able corps was formed,
consisting of a company and a half at Much Wenlock, a company and
a half at Broseley, and half a company at Little Wenlock;
altogether forming a battalion of 280 men.&nbsp; For the county
altogether there were raised 940 cavalry, 5,022 infantry; rank
and file, 5,852.&nbsp; Mr. Harries, of Benthall; Mr. Turner, of
Caughley; Mr. Pritchard and Mr. Onions, of Broseley; Messrs. W.
and R. Anstice, of Madeley Wood and Coalport; Mr. Collins, Mr.
Jeffries, and Mr. Hinton, of Wenlock; and others, were among the
officers and leading members.&nbsp; The uniform was handsome, the
coat being scarlet, turned up with yellow, the trousers and
waistcoat white, and the hat a cube, with white and red feathers
for the grenadiers, and green ones for the light company.&nbsp;
The old hall once more resounded with martial music, the clang of
arms, and patriotic songs; drums and fifes, clarionets and
bugles, were piled up with guns and accoutrements in the form of
trophies, above the massive chimney-piece, putting the
deer-horns, the foxes&rsquo; heads, and the old cabinets of
oak&mdash;black as ebony&mdash;out of countenance by their gaudy
colouring.&nbsp; People became as familiar with the music of
military bands <a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>as with the sound of church bells; both were heard
together on Sundays, the days generally selected for drill, for
heavy taxes were laid on, and people had to work hard to pay
them, which they did willingly.&nbsp; The Squire had the women on
his side, and he worked upon the men through the women.&nbsp;
There was open house at Willey, and no baron of olden time dealt
out hospitality more willingly or more liberally.&nbsp; The
Squire was here, there, and everywhere, visiting neighbouring
squires, giving or receiving information, stirring up the gentry,
and frightening country people out of their wits.&nbsp;
<i>Boney</i> became more terrible than <i>bogy</i>, both to
children and grown-up persons; and the more vague the notion of
invasion to Shropshire inlanders, the more horrible the evils to
be dreaded.&nbsp; The clergy preached about Bonaparte out of the
Revelations; conjurers and &ldquo;wise-men,&rdquo; greater
authorities even then than the clergy, saw a connection between
Bonaparte and the strange lights which every one had seen in the
heavens!&nbsp; The popular notion was that &ldquo;Boney&rdquo;
was an undefined, horrible monster, who had a sheep dressed every
morning for breakfast, who required an ox for his dinner, and had
six little English children cooked&mdash;when he <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>could get
them&mdash;for supper!&nbsp; At the name of &ldquo;Boney&rdquo;
naughty children were frightened, and a false alarm of his coming
and landing often made grown-up men turn pale.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;This way and
that the anxious mind is torn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The impulse was in proportion to the alarm; the determination
raised was spirited and praiseworthy.&nbsp; Stout hearts
constituted an <i>impromptu</i> force, daily advancing in
organization, with arms and accoutrements, ready to march with
knapsacks to any point where numbers might be required.&nbsp;
Once or twice, when a company received orders to march, as to
Bridgnorth, for instance, an alarm was created among wives,
daughters, and sweethearts, that they were about to join the
battalion for active service, and stories are told of
leave-takings and weepings on such occasions.&nbsp; Beacons were
erected, and bonfires prepared on the highest points of the
country round, as being the quickest means of transmitting news
of the approach of an enemy.&nbsp; Of these watch-fire signals,
Macaulay says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On and on, without a horse untired, they
hounded still<br />
All night from tower to tower, they sprang from hill to hill,<br
/>
<a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>Till the
proud peak unfurled the flag o&rsquo;er Derwent&rsquo;s rocky
dales,&mdash;<br />
Till like volcanoes flared to heaven the stormy hills of
Wales,&mdash;<br />
Till twelve fair counties saw the blaze on Malvern&rsquo;s lonely
height,&mdash;<br />
Till streamed in crimson on the wind the Wrekin&rsquo;s crest of
light&mdash;<br />
Till broad and fierce the star came forth on Elsig&rsquo;s
stately fane,<br />
And tower and hamlet rose in arms o&rsquo;er all the boundless
plain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within a mile of Willey Hall a tenant of Squire Forester, and,
as we have seen, an occasional guest&mdash;John Wilkinson,
&ldquo;the great ironmaster&rdquo;&mdash;was urging his men day
and night to push the manufacture of shot, shell, howitzers, and
guns, which Mr. Forester believed were for the government of the
country, but many of which were designed for its enemies.&nbsp;
Night and day heavy hammers were thundering, day and night the
&ldquo;great blast&rdquo; was blowing.&nbsp; He was well known to
the French government and French engineers, having erected the
first steam engine there in 1785, for which he was highly
complimented by the Duke d&rsquo;Angouleme, M. Bertrand, and
others, and treated to a grand banquet, given to him on the 14th
of January, 1786, at the H&ocirc;tel de Ville.&nbsp; Arthur
Young, in his travels in France, tells us that until this
well-known English manufacturer arrived the French <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>knew
nothing of the art of casting cannon from the solid, and then
boring them.&nbsp; When Wilkinson returned to England, he
continued to send guns after war had been declared.&nbsp; This
clandestine proceeding came to the knowledge of Squire Forester,
who swore, and roared like a caged lion.&nbsp; Here was the
Squire, who boasted of his loyalty to good King George, having
the minerals of his estate worked up into guns for those wretched
French, whom he detested.&nbsp; He declared he would hunt
Wilkinson out of the country; but the latter took care to keep
out of his way.</p>
<p>The exposure ended in a seizure being made.&nbsp; But
Wilkinson, a money-getting, unprincipled fellow, finding he could
not send guns openly, sent best gun-iron in rude blocks, with a
pretence that they were for ballast for shipping, but which, like
some of his water-pipes, were used for making guns.&nbsp; His
warehouse was at Willey Wharf, on the Severn, by which they were
sent, when there was sufficient water, in barges, which took them
out into the British Channel, and round the coast to French
cruisers; and it was at this wharf he built his first famous iron
barge.&nbsp; The proprietors of the Calcutts furnaces, at which
young Cochrane, <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>afterwards Earl Dundonald&mdash;one of the last of our
old &ldquo;Sea Lions&rdquo;&mdash;spent some time, when a boy,
with his father, Lord Dundonald, <a name="citation171"></a><a
href="#footnote171" class="citation">[171]</a> were also casting
and boring guns; but, in consequence of refusing to fee
Government servants at Woolwich, the manufacturers had a number
of them thrown upon their hands, which they sold to a firm at
Rotherham, and which found their way to India, where they were
recognised by old workmen in the army, who captured them during
the Sikh war.&nbsp; At the same time cannon which burst, and did
almost as much damage to the English as to their enemies, were
palmed off upon the nation.</p>
<p>Mr. Forester wrote to the Duke of York, who came down,
accompanied by the Prince of Orange, to examine the guns for
himself; and a number of 18 and 32-pounders were fired in honour
of the event.&nbsp; Others were subjected to various tests, to
the entire satisfaction of the visitors.</p>
<p>At this period the Willey country presented a spectacle
altogether unparalleled in Mr. Forester&rsquo;s <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>experience;
his entire sympathy and that of his fox-hunting friends was
enlisted in the warlike movements everywhere going forward, for
the standards of the Wenlock and Morfe Volunteers now drew around
them men of all classes.&nbsp; Farmers allowed their ploughs to
stand still in the furrows, that the peasant might hurry with the
artisan, musket on shoulder, to his rallying point in the fields
near Wenlock, Broseley, or Bridgnorth.&nbsp; Whigs and Tories
stood beside each other in the Volunteer ranks, heart-burnings
and divisions as to principles and policy were for the time
forgotten, and the Squire, although now unable to take the same
active part he formerly did, contributed materially by his
presence and advice to the zeal and alacrity which distinguished
his neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> Addison&rsquo;s Sir Roger de

friend among his neighbours, and a good master amongst <a

servants, who seldom changed.&nbsp; He feasted the rich, and did

&lsquo;Sirrah, is there going to be any stir here
to-day?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Aye, lad,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;come
in, and see;&rsquo; and danged if he didn&rsquo;t get the
horse-whip and stir me round the kitchen, where he pretended to
flog me, laughing the while ready to split his sides.&nbsp; He
gave me a rare blow out though, and my mother found half-a-crown
at the bottom of the jug when she poured out the
barm.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you ever hear of his being worsted
by the sweep?&rdquo; said another.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was generally
a match for most, but the sweep was too much for him.&nbsp; The
Squire had been out, and, being caught in a storm, he called at a
public-house to shelter.&nbsp; Seeing that it was Mr. Forester,
the <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>customers made way for him to sit next the fire, and
whilst he was drying himself a sweep came to the door, and looked
in; but, seeing the Squire, he was making off again.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hollo,&rsquo; said Mr. Forester, &lsquo;what news from the
lower region?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; replied the sweep,
&lsquo;things are going on there, Squire, much as they are
here&mdash;the <i>gentlemen are nearest the
fire</i>!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; A third of our informants remarked:
&ldquo;He was one of the old sort, but a right &rsquo;un.&nbsp;
Why, when there was a bad harvest, and no work for men, after one
of them war times, and the colliers were rioting and going to
break open the shops, to tear down the flour mill, and do other
damage, the old Squire was the only man that could stop
them&mdash;he had such influence with the people.&nbsp; The poor
never wanted a friend whilst old George Forester lived.&nbsp;
There were plenty of broken victuals to be had for the fetching,
a tankard of right good ale, with bread and cheese, or cold
mutton, for all comers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The years 1774&ndash;1782 were periods of local gloom and
distress, when haggard hunger and ignorant force banded together
to trample down the safeguards of civil rights, and armed
ruffians took the initiative in violent scrambles for food.&nbsp;
The <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>cavalry were called out, and fierce battles were fought
in the iron districts, where the rioters sometimes took refuge on
cinder heaps, which supplied them with sharp cutting
missiles.&nbsp; In 1795 the colliers and iron-workers being in a
state of commotion, were only prevented from rising by assurances
that gentlemen of property were disposed to contribute liberally
to their relief, and thousands of bushels of Indian corn were
obtained by the Squire and others from Liverpool to add to the
grain procurable in the neighbourhood to meet immediate
necessities.&nbsp; A meeting of gentlemen, farmers, millers, and
tradesmen was held at the Tontine Hotel, on the 9th of July in
that year, to consider the state of things arising out of the
scarcity of corn and the dearness of all other provisions, at
which a committee was formed for the immediate collection of
contributions and the purchase of grain at a reduction of
one-fourth, or 9<i>s.</i> for 12<i>s.</i>&nbsp; Mr. Forester at
once gave notice to all his tenants to deliver wheat to the
committee at 12<i>s.</i>, whilst he himself gave &pound;105, and
agreed to advance &pound;700 more, to be repaid from the produce
of the corn sold at a reduced price.&nbsp; Such were the wants of
the district, the murmurs of <a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>the inhabitants, and the
distinctions made between those who were considered benefactors,
and others who were not, that fear was entertained of a general
uprising; and application was made to Mr. Forester, both as a
friend and a magistrate.&nbsp; He assumed more the character of
the former, and his presence acted like magic upon the rough
miners, who by his kindness and tact were at once put into good
humour.&nbsp; Having brought waggons of coal, drawn with ropes,
for sale, the first thing the Squire did was to purchase the
coal: he then bought up all the butter in the market, and
purchased all the bread in the town, he emptied the
butchers&rsquo; shops in the same way, and advised the men to go
home with the provisions he gave them.</p>
<p>We are quite aware that it might be said that Squire Forester
was not a model for imitation; and it might be replied that no
man ever was, altogether, even for men of his own time, much less
for those of one or two generations removed, always excepting Him
whose name should never be uttered lightly, and in whom the human
and divine were combined.&nbsp; He had sufficient inherent good
qualities, however, to make half a dozen ordinary <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>modern
country gentlemen popular; still his one failing, shared among
the same number, might no less damn them in the eyes of
society.</p>
<p>Some would, no doubt, have liked Dibdin&rsquo;s heroes better
if he had been less truthful, by making the language more
agreeable to the ear, by substituting, as one writer has said,
&ldquo;dear me&rdquo; for &ldquo;damme,&rdquo; and lemonade for
grog; but such critics are what Dibdin himself called
&ldquo;lubbers&rdquo; and &ldquo;swabs.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the same
way, some would be for toning down the characters of Squire
Forester and Parson Stephens; but this would be a mistake: an
artist might as well smooth over with vegetation every
out-cropping rock he finds in his foreground.&nbsp; We might say
a great deal more about the old Squire, and the Willey Rector
too, but there is no reason why we should say less.&nbsp; If we
err, we err with the best and gravest writers of history, who,
without fear or favour, wrote of things as they found them; and
those who are familiar with the writings of men of the
past&mdash;such as the Sixth Satire of Juvenal, will admit that
men like Squire Forester were examples of modesty.&nbsp; Men of
all grades, every day, are brought in contact with much that
might more strongly be objected to in the public Press; and there
is no reason why the <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>veil should not be raised in order
that we may view the past as it really was.</p>
<p>The fact is, the Squire found the atmosphere of the times
congenial to his temperament.&nbsp; A very popular Shropshire
rake and play writer, Wycherley, had done much to lower the tone
of morality by representing peccadilloes, not as something which
the violence of passion may excuse, but as accomplishments worthy
of gentlemen,&mdash;his &ldquo;Country Wife&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Plain Dealer&rdquo; being examples.&nbsp; Congreve
followed in his wake, with his &ldquo;Old Bachelor,&rdquo; which
may be judged by its apothegm:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What rugged ways attend the noon of
life;<br />
Our sun declines, and with what anxious strife,<br />
What pain, we tug that galling load&mdash;a wife!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fair estimate of the looseness of the time may be formed
from another representation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The miracle to-day is, that we find<br />
A lover true, not that a woman&rsquo;s kind;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and from the fact that even Pope, in his &ldquo;Epistle to a
Lady,&rdquo; out of his mature experience could write&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Men some to business, some to pleasure
take,<br />
But every woman is at heart a rake.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>The
Squire had been jilted, and breathing such an atmosphere, no
wonder he cast lingering looks to the time</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ere one to one was cursedly
confined,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or that he never married.&nbsp; It is fortunate he did not,
for Venus herself, we fancy, could not have kept him by her
side.&nbsp; His amours were notorious, and some of his mistresses
were rare specimens of rustic beauty.&nbsp; Two daring spirits
who followed the hounds were regular Dianas in their way, and he
spent much of his time in the rural little cottages of these and
others which were dotted over the estate at no great distance
from the Hall.&nbsp; As rare Ben Jonson has it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When some one peculiar quality<br />
Doth so possess a man that it doth draw<br />
All his effects, his spirits, and his powers,<br />
In their confluction all to run one way,<br />
This may be truly said to be a humour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such a humour the old Squire had.&nbsp; Towards the last he
found that some of his mistresses gave him a good deal of
trouble; for in carrying out his desire to leave them comfortably
provided for, his best intentions created jealousy, and he found
it difficult to adjust their claims as regarded matters of
income, Ph&oelig;be Higgs, who survived the Squire <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>many years,
and lived in a cottage with land attached, on the Willey side of
the Shirlot, being the most clamorous.&nbsp; She set out one
night with the intention of shooting the Squire, but was unnerved
by her favourite monkey, who had stealthily gone on before, and
jumped unobserved on her shoulder as she opened a gate.&nbsp; On
another occasion she succeeded in surprising the Squire by
forcing her way into his room and pointing a loaded pistol at him
across the table, vowing she would shoot him unless he promised
to make the sum left for her maintenance equal to that of Miss
Cal&mdash;t.&nbsp; He had his children educated; they frequently
visited at the Hall, and some married well.&nbsp; He speaks of
them as his children and grandchildren in his letters, and
manifested the greatest anxiety that everything should be done
that could be done, by provisions in his will for those he was
about to leave behind him.&nbsp; Indeed the same characteristics
which gave a colouring to his life distinguished him to the last;
and if the old fires burnt less brightly, the same inner sense
and outward manifestations were evident in all he did.</p>
<p>One thing which troubled him was the chancel of Barrow Church,
as will be seen by the following <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>characteristic letter to his agent,
Mr. Pritchard, asking him to procure a legal opinion about
certain encroachments upon what he conceived to be his rights,
and those of the parishioners:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear
Sir</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must remember Parson Jones has oft been talking to
me about the pews put up, unfairly, I think, in the chancel of
Barrow church.&nbsp; The whole of the chancel is mine as patron,
and I am always obliged to do all the repairs to it, whenever
wanted.&nbsp; There is a little small pew in it of very ancient
date, besides these other two; in this, I suppose, it is intended
to thrust poor me, the patron, into; humble and meek, and
deprived of every comfort on my own spot, the chancel.&nbsp; The
parson, you know, has been saucy on the occasion, as you know all
black Toms are, and therefore I&rsquo;ll now know my power from
Mr. Mytton, and set the matter straight somehow or other.&nbsp; I
can safely swear at this minute a dozen people of this parish
(crowd as they will) can&rsquo;t receive the Sacrament together,
and therefore, instead of there being pews of any kind therein,
there ought to be none at all, but a free unencumbered chancel at
this hour.&nbsp; <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>Rather than be as it is, I&rsquo;ll be at the expense
of pulling the present chancel down, rebuilding and enlarging it,
so as to make all convenient and clever, before I&rsquo;ll suffer
these encroachments attended with every insult upon earth.&nbsp;
Surely upon a representation to the bishop that the present
chancel is much too small, and that the patron, at his own
expense, wishes to enlarge it, I cannot think but it will be
comply&rsquo;d with.&nbsp; If this is not Mr. Mytton&rsquo;s
opinion as the best way, what is? and how am I to manage these
encroaches?</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Yours ever,<br />
&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;If the old chancel is taken down, I&rsquo;ll
take care that no pew shall stand in the new one.&nbsp; Mr.
Mytton will properly turn this in his mind, and I&rsquo;ll then
face the old kit of them boldly.&nbsp; The old pew I spoke of,
besides the other two in the chancel (mean and dirty as it is to
a degree), yet the parson wants to let, if he does not do so now,
to any person that comes to church, no matter who, so long as he
gets the cash.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so small no one can sit with
bended knees in it; and, in short, the whole chancel is not more
than one-half as big as the little room I <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>am now
seated in; which must apparently show you, and, on your
representation, Mr. Mytton likewise, how much too small it must
be for so large a parish as Barrow, and with the addition of
three pews&mdash;one very large indeed, the next to hold two or
three people abreast, and the latter about three sideways, always
standing, and totally unable to kneel in the least
comfort.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Years were beginning to tell upon the old sportsman, reminding
him that his career was drawing to a close, and he appeared to
apprehend the truth Sir Thomas Brown embodied in the remark, that
every hour adds to the current arithmetic, which scarce stands
one moment; and since &ldquo;the longest sun sets at right
declensions,&rdquo; he looked forward to that setting and made
arrangements accordingly, which were in perfect keeping with the
character of the man.&nbsp; He felt that his day was done, that
night was coming on; and it was his wish that those who knew him
best should be those chosen to attend his funeral, that his
domestics and servants who had experienced his kindness should
carry him to the tomb.&nbsp; And let it be when the sun goes
down, when the work of the day is done; let each have a guinea,
<a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>that he
may meet his neighbour afterwards and talk over, if he likes, the
merits and demerits of his old master, as none&mdash;next to his
Maker&mdash;know them better.&nbsp; The provisions in the will of
the old Squire, in which he left his estates to his cousin Cecil,
afterwards Lord Forester, father of the present Right Hon. Lord
Forester, made about five years before his death, were evidently
made in this spirit.</p>
<p>He became ill at one of his cottages on Shirlot, was taken
home, attended by Dr. Thursfield (grandfather of the present
Greville Thursfield, M.D.), and died whilst the doctor was still
with him, on the 13th of July, 1811, in the seventy-third year of
his age.</p>

<p>His wishes, we need scarcely say, were carried out to the
letter.&nbsp; He was buried by torchlight in the family vault in
Willey Church, beneath the family pew, to which the steps shown
in our engraving lead.&nbsp; Founded and endowed by the lords of
Willey at some remote period, this venerable edifice has
remained, with the exception of its chancel, the same as we see
it, for many generations past.&nbsp; It stands within the shadow
of the Old Hall, <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Gray&rsquo;s ivy-mantled tower, where</p>

<p>being covered with a luxuriant growth of this clinging
evergreen to the very top.&nbsp; Standing beneath, and peering
through the Norman-looking windows, which admit but a sober
light, glimpses are obtained of costly monuments with the names
and titles of patrons whose escutcheons are visible against the
wall.&nbsp; The Squire&rsquo;s tomb remains uninscribed; but in
1821 Cecil Weld, the first Lord Forester, erected a marble tablet
near, with the simple record&mdash;&ldquo;To the memory of my
late cousin and benefactor, George Forester, Esq., Willey Park,

<p><span class="smcap">Strutt</span>, quoting from the book of

<p>Mr. Eyton, to whose learned and valuable work on the
&ldquo;Antiquities of Shropshire&rdquo; the author again
acknowledges his obligations, as all who follow that painstaking
writer must do, with regard to the holding at the More, says,
&ldquo;The earliest notice of this tenure which occurs in the
Roll of Shropshire Sergeantries, is dated 13th of <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>John, 1211,
and merely says that Richard de Medler holds one virgate of land,
and renders for the same annually, at the Feast of St. Michael,
two knives (knifeulos).&nbsp; A second contemporary roll supplies
the place of payment, viz., the Exchequer; a third writes the
name, Richard le Mener.&nbsp; In 1245 Nicholas de More is said to
pay at the Exchequer two knives (cultellos)&mdash;one good, the
other very bad&mdash;for certain land which he holds of the King
in capite in More.&nbsp; In 1255 the Stottesden Jurors report
that Nicholas de Medler holds one virgate in More, in capite of
the Lord King, rendering at the Exchequer two knives, one of
which ought to cut a hazel rod, and he does no other service for
the said land.&nbsp; In that of 1274 Jurors of the same Hundred
say at length that Nicholas de la More holds one virgate in that
vill of the Lord King, in capite, by sergeantry, of taking two
knives to the King&rsquo;s Exchequer, at the feast of St. Michael
in each year, so that he ought to cut a hazel rod with one knife,
so that the knife should bend (plicare) with the stroke; and
again, to cut a rod with the other knife.&nbsp; The record of
1284 describes Nicholas de la More as holding three parts of a
virgate and two moors, by sergeantry, &amp;c.&nbsp; The Jurors of
Oct. 1292 say that William de la More, of Erdington, holds one
virgate in the More, by sergeantry of taking two knives to the
King&rsquo;s Exchequer on the morrow of St. Michael, and to cut
with the same knives two hazel rods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This bold projecting rock is called, from Major Thomas,
&ldquo;Smallman&rsquo;s Leap,&rdquo; from a tradition that the
major, a staunch Royalist, being surprised by a party of
Cromwell&rsquo;s horse, was singly and hotly pursued over
Westwood, where, finding all hope of escape at an end, he turned
from the road, hurried his horse into a full gallop to the edge
of the precipice, and went over.&nbsp; The horse was killed by
falling on the trees beneath, but the major escaped, and secreted
himself in the woods.&nbsp; Certain historical facts, showing
that the family long resided here, appear to give a colouring to
this tradition.&nbsp; Thus, in the reign of Henry III. (57th
year) William Smallman had a lease from John Lord of Brockton par
Shipton, Corvedale, of 17&frac12; acres of land, with a sytche,
called Woolsytche, and two parcels of meadow in the fields of
Brockton.&nbsp; John Smallman possessed by lease and grant, from
Thomas de la Lake, 30 acres of land in the fields of Larden par
Shipton, for twenty years from the feast of St. Michael, living
4th Edward II. (1310) 41st Edward III. (1367), Richard Smallman,
of Shipton, granted to Roger Powke, of Brockton, all his lands
and tenements in the township and fields of Shipton, as fully as
was contained in an original deed.&nbsp; Witnesses&mdash;John de
Galford, Sir Roger Mon (Chaplain), Henry de Stanwy, John
Tyklewardyne (Ticklarton), of Stanton, John de Gurre of the same,
with others.&nbsp; 1st Henry VI. (1422), John Smallman was
intrusted with the collection of the subsidies of <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>taxes
payable to the Crown within the franchise of Wenlock.&nbsp;
Thomas Smallman, of Elton, co. Harford, and Inner Temple,
barrister-at-law, afterwards a Welsh judge, purchased the manor
of Wilderhope, Stanway, and the teg and estates, and had a
numerous grant of arms, 5th October, 1589.&nbsp; Major Thomas
Smallman, a staunch royalist, born 1624, compounded for his
estate &pound;140.</p>
<p>Underneath this bold projecting headland, sometimes called
&ldquo;Ipikin&rsquo;s Rock,&rdquo; is Ipikin&rsquo;s Cave, an
excavation very difficult of approach, where tradition alleges a
bold outlaw long concealed himself and his horse, and from which
he issued to make some predatory excursion.</p>
<p>The term <i>hope</i>, both as a prefix and termination, is of
such frequent occurrence here that it is only natural to suppose
that it has some special signification; and looking at the
positions of Prest<i>hope</i>, East<i>hope</i>,
Millic<i>hope</i>, Middle<i>hope</i>, Wilder<i>hope</i>,
<i>Hope</i>say, and <i>Hope</i> Bowdler, that signification
appears to be a recess, or place remote between the hills.&nbsp;
Easthope is a rural little village about two miles beyond
Ipikin&rsquo;s Rock, pleasantly situated in one of these long
natural troughs which follow the direction of Wenlock Edge.</p>
<p>It appears to have been within the Long Forest, and is
mentioned in Domesday as being held in Saxon times by Eruni and
Uluric; it was afterwards held by Edric de Esthop, and others of
the same name.&nbsp; There was a church here as early as 1240,
and in the graveyard, between two ancient yews, are two tombs,
without either date or inscription, in which two monks connected
with <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>the
Abbey of Wenlock are supposed to have been interred.</p>
<p>Near Easthope, and about midway between Larden Hall and
Lutwyche Hall, is an enclosure comprising about eight acres, or
an encampment, forming nearly an entire circle, surrounded by
inner and outer fosses.&nbsp; The internal slope of the inner
wall is 12 feet, and externally 25, while the crest of the
parapet is 6 feet broad.&nbsp; The relief of the second vallum
rises 10 feet from the fosse, and is about 12 feet across its
parapet.&nbsp; There is also a second ditch, but it is almost
obliterated.&nbsp; It is supposed to have been a military post,
forming an important link in the chain of British entrenchments
which stretched throughout this portion of the county.&nbsp; Near
it a mound resembling a tumulus was opened some years since by
the Rev. R. More and T. Mytton, Esq., and in or near which a
British urn of baked clay was discovered, on another occasion,
while making a drain.</p>

Family</span>, <i>Page</i> <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page69">69</a></span>.</h3>
<p>In his &ldquo;Sheriffs of Shropshire,&rdquo; Mr. Blakeway in
speaking of the Forester family, says: &ldquo;They were
originally Foresters, an office much coveted by our ancestors,
which latter seems probable, from the fact, that on the Pipe
Rolls of 1214, Hugh Forester accounts for a hundred merks that he
may hold the bailiwick of the forest of Salopscire, as his father
held it before him.&rdquo;&nbsp; King John, however, remits
thirty merks of the payment in consequence of Hugh having taken
to wife the niece of John l&rsquo;Estrange, at <i>His
Majesty&rsquo;s request</i>.&nbsp; It does not seem clear,
however, that Hugh, the son of Robert, can be traced to have been
in the direct line of the Willey family, he having been ancestor
to Roger, son of John, the first of the king&rsquo;s six
foresters.&nbsp; The other, Robert de Wellington, the late Mr.
George Morris, in his &ldquo;Genealogies of the Principal Landed
Proprietors,&rdquo; now in the possession of T. C. Eyton, Esq.,
to whose kindness we are indebted for this extract, says was the
earliest person that can certainly be called ancestor of the
present family of Forester.&nbsp; His sergeantry is described as
the custody of the King&rsquo;s Hay of Eyton, of which, and
several adjoining manors, Peter de Eyton, lineal ancestor of the
present Thomas Campbell Eyton, of Eyton, and grandson of Robert
de Eyton, who gave the whole of the Buttery estate to Shrewsbury
Abbey, was the lord.</p>
<p>Thomas, a son of Robert Forester of Wellington, in <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>the Hundred
Rolls, in 1254, is said by the king&rsquo;s justices itinerant to
hold half a virgate of the king to keep the Hay of
Wellington.&nbsp; Roger le Forester of Wellington, who succeeded
Robert, appears to have died 1277&ndash;8, and to have left two
sons, Robert and Roger.&nbsp; Robert had property in Wellington
and the Bailiwick of the forest of the Wrekin, and is supposed to
have succeeded his father, whom he did not long survive, having
died the year following, 1278&ndash;9.&nbsp; Roger his brother
succeeded to his possession, and held also the Hay of Wellington,
of which he died seized in 1284&ndash;5.&nbsp; Robert, the
Forester of Wellington, Mr. Blakeway says, occurs in the Hundred
Roll of Bradford in 1287, and is shown to have held the Hay of
Wellington till 1292&ndash;3, when Roger, son of Roger, proving
himself of age, paid the king one merk as a relief for his lands
in Wellington, held by sergeantry, to keep Wellington Hay, in the
forest of the Wrekin, &amp;c.&nbsp; This is the Roger de
Wellington before-mentioned, as one of King Edward&rsquo;s
foresters by fee, recorded in his Great Charter of the forests of
Salopssier, in the perambulation of 1300.&nbsp; He died 1331.</p>
<p>John le Forester, as John, son and heir of Roger le Forester
de Welynton, succeeded to the property, and proved himself of age
in the reign of Edward III., 1335.&nbsp; With John de Eyton he
attested a grant in Wellington, and died 24th of Edward III.,
1350.</p>
<p>William le Forester succeeded his father, John, in 1377, and
died 19th of Richard II., 1395.</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>In
1397 Roger Forester de Wellington is described as holding
Wellington Hay and Chace.&nbsp; He died in 1402.</p>
<p>Roger, his son and heir, was in 1416 appointed keeper of the
same haia by the Duchess of Norfolk and the Lady Bergavenny,
sisters and co-heiresses of the great Thomas Fitz-Alan, Earl of
Arundel.</p>
<p>His son and successor, John, died 5th of Edward IV. 1465,
seized of the lands, &amp;c., in Wellington, and the custody of
the forest of the Wrekin.&nbsp; He had two sons, William and
John, also a son Richard; and William, son of the above, appears
to have been the father of another John, the former John having
died without issue.&nbsp; John, in 1506, witnesses a deed of
Thomas Cresset, as John Forester the younger; he married Joice
Upton, the heiress of Philip Upton, of Upton under Haymond, and
obtained the estate of that place, which is still inherited by
his descendants.</p>
<p>This John Forester first resided in Watling Street, where his
ancestors for several generations had lived, in the old timbered
mansion, now occupied by Dr. Cranage, but he afterwards removed
to Easthope, whilst his son William resided at Upton; and Richard
Forester, alias Forster of Sutton Maddock, secretary to Bishop
Bonner, who built the old mansion in Bridgnorth, called
&ldquo;Forester&rsquo;s Folly,&rdquo; which was burnt down during
the siege of the castle, when the high town became a heap of
ruins, appears to have been a son of John Forester, of Easthope;
and Anthony Forester or Foster of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s novel,
who was born about 1510, was a son of his.</p>
<p><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>In
the 34th of Henry VIII., 1542&ndash;3, Thomas Foster and
Elizabeth his wife, account in the Exchequer for several
temporalities in connection with the monastery of St.
Peter&rsquo;s, Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Sir William Forester, KB.,
married Lady Mary Cecil, daughter of James, third Earl of
Salisbury.&nbsp; He was a staunch Protestant, and represented the
county with George Weld, as previously stated, with whom he voted
in favour of the succession of the House of Hanover, and the
family came into possession of the Willey estates by the marriage
of Brook Forester of Dothill Park, with one of the Welds, the
famous George Forester, the Willey Squire, being the fruit of
that marriage.&nbsp; George Forester left the whole of his
estates to his cousin, Cecil Forester, of Ross Hall, who was
allowed by George the Fourth, whose personal friendship he had
been permitted to enjoy for many years, to add the name of Weld
in 1821.&nbsp; Cecil Weld Forester, Esq., was ennobled the same
year by George the Fourth, who, when Prince of Wales, honoured
him with a visit at Ross Hall.&nbsp; He married Catherine,
daughter of His Grace the fourth Duke of Rutland, and was not
less renowned than his cousin, as a sportsman.&nbsp; His
eagerness for the chase was happily characterised by the late Mr.
Meynell, who used to say, &ldquo;First out of cover came Cecil
Forester, next the fox, and then my hounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; A famous
leap of his, thirty feet across a stream, on his famous horse
Bernardo, has been recorded in some lines now at Willey which
accompany the portrait of the horse.&nbsp; He is supposed to have
been one of the first who instituted <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>the present system of hard riding to
hounds, and a horse known to have been ridden by him, it is said,
would at any time fetch &pound;20 more than the ordinary
price.&nbsp; Speaking of the classic proportions of a horse, and
the perfection of the art of riding in connection with his
lordship as a sportsman, Colonel Apperley, remarked some years
ago, &ldquo;Unless a man sits gracefully on his horse, and
handles him well, that fine effect is lost.&nbsp; As the poet
says, he would be incorporated with the brave beast, and such
does Lord Forester appear to be.&nbsp; His eye to a country is
also remarkably quick, and his knowledge of Leicestershire has
given him no small advantage.&nbsp; On one occasion he
disregarded the good old English custom of &lsquo;looking before
you leap,&rsquo; and landed in the middle of a deep pool.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hold on,&rsquo; a countryman who saw him, shouted to
others coming in the same direction.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hold your
tongue&mdash;say nothing, we shall have it full in a
minute,&rsquo; said Lord Forester.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Colonel
added, &ldquo;In consequence of residing in Shropshire, a country
which has been so long famous for its breed of horses, he has a
good opportunity of mounting himself well.&nbsp; He always
insisted on the necessity of lengthy shoulders, good fetlocks,
well formed hind legs and open feet; and knowing better than to
confound strength and size, his horses seldom exceeded fifteen
hands.&nbsp; On anything relating to a hunter his authority has
long been considered classic, and if Forester said so it was
enough.&nbsp; Lord Forester will always stand pre-eminent in the
field, whilst in private life he is a very friendly man, and <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>has ever
adhered to those principles of honour and integrity which
characterise the gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died on the 23rd of
May, 1828, in his 61st year.&nbsp; He had, as we have said, ten
children, the gallant Frank Forester, as Colonel Apperley styles
him, being one.&nbsp; The oldest was the present Right Hon. J. G.
W. Forester, whose popularity in connection with the Belvoir Hunt
is so well known.</p>
<p>His lordship, whose portrait we give at the commencement of
this work, and who is now in the 73rd year of his age, has added
very much to the Willey estates, both by purchase and by
improvements, and is very much esteemed by his tenantry.</p>
<p>The Right Hon. General Forester, who succeeded his brother in
the representation of Wenlock, has sat for the borough for
forty-five years, and is now the Father of the House of
Commons.&nbsp; Whether out-door exercises, associated with the
pleasures of the chase, to which the ancestors of the Foresters
have devoted themselves for so many centuries, have anything to
do with it or not we cannot say; but the Foresters are remarkable
for masculine and feminine beauty, and the General has frequently
been spoken of by the press as the best looking man in the House
of Commons.&nbsp; Neither he nor his elder brother, the present
Rt. Hon. Lord Forester, are likely to leave behind them direct
issue.&nbsp; The younger brother, the Hon. and Rev. O. W. W.
Forester, has one son, Cecil, who has several sons to perpetuate
the name of Forester, which we hope will long be associated with
Willey.</p>

<p>The following is a recent Review of the Book:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We do not know any similar kind of work,
and we believe that it will stand alone in the speciality of its
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In addition to much adventure resulting from a nomadic
life in a foreign country, it contains descriptions of scenery,
besides information which may instruct the philologist.&nbsp; A
carefully prepared map shows the routes and camp grounds of the
Author&rsquo;s nomadic expedition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work, in consequence of the death of his late
Majesty, Carl XV., on the 18th Sept., 1872, is dedicated by
permission of his present Majesty, Oscar II., &lsquo;<i>In
Memoriam</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work has clearly been undertaken at considerable
cost, and the scenes of travel described extend over nearly 2,000
miles of sea and land traversed by the Author with tents,
gipsies, animal commissariat, and baggage, independent of any
other shelter or accommodation than what he took with him.&nbsp;
In the course of the expedition one of the highest waterfalls of
Norway was visited, &lsquo;Morte fos,&rsquo; and the highest
mountain in Norway, the &lsquo;Galdhossiggen&rsquo; was
ascended.&nbsp; The book is cheap at a guinea, being illustrated
with five full-page engravings, all of which are taken from the
Author&rsquo;s original sketches, or photographs specially
obtained for the purpose; they are beautiful works of Art, and
are admirably executed by the celebrated Mr. Edward Whymper,
Author of &lsquo;Scrambles amongst the Alps.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>Court Journal</i>, speaking of the productions
exhibited by William Pugh, Esq., May, 1871, says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We do not think that any porcelain
productions would equal those of the Coalport works.&nbsp; The
show-case that the owners exhibit independently, and their
manufactures, displayed by various firms, have, in all instances,
the highest merit.&nbsp; We are well aware we shall be informed
that our praise is but a stale echo, as this firm is renowned of
old for producing the finest china, having some process of
blending or applying chemical agencies known only to themselves,
and being celebrated over Europe for the beautiful colour of the
gold&mdash;a matter of course of very considerable consequence,
as it is used so bounteously in the ornamentation of
china.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an article on the &ldquo;world&rsquo;s great show,&rdquo;
as the Viennese were pleased to call it, the same Journal
remarked&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We have latterly challenged the continental
world to compete with us and to contend for equality in many
branches of manufacture into which art excellence <a
name="page2_4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>and
refinement of taste enter, and we have carried off the
palm.&nbsp; Neither S&egrave;vres nor Dresden has of late years
compared with the best English productions.&nbsp; There is no
doubt of this; and most especially we might instance as
successful rivalry the progress that the Coalport Works have
made.&nbsp; The marked patronage of Royal circles on the
Continent and at home for their productions is, perhaps, the best
proof of the truth of our statement. . . .&nbsp; They have been
especially practical in their catering for the Vienna Exhibition,
and met the foreigner at his weak point rather than courted
rivalry at his strongest.&nbsp; No nation on the Continent can
compete with the French as regards the painting, though Coalport
could and will challenge with every hope of success for the first
place when it comes to the question of rivalry in design,
exquisite form, graceful ornamentation, brilliancy of colour,
bright burnish of gold, and tenderness of glaze in merely
decorative porcelain works.&nbsp; The specimens of this character
which are sent will, we are sure, worthily maintain the
reputation of Coalport.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The <i>Standard</i> also, May 23, 1873, in an article on the
&ldquo;Ceramic Art,&rdquo; had the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Messrs. Daniell have so many good things
from Coalport Works that it would be difficult to present even a
brief mention of them all.&nbsp; There is one beautiful pair of
vases in imitation Cashmere ware which Sir R. Wallace has already
purchased, and the same gentleman has also secured a number of
plates delightfully painted by Faugeron with exotic leaves.&nbsp;
Two portrait vases of the Emperor and Empress of Austria are of
old S&egrave;vres shape, the bodies being of turquoise and gold,
and the paintings by Palmere, almost miniatures in their fine
detail.&nbsp; Two gros bleu vases, with raised and chased gold
ornamentation and panels, choicely painted with birds by Randall,
are as elegant as a pair of jardini&egrave;res, with a cobalt
ground and gold ferns and grasses in relief, butterflies touched
up in bright enamel, toning the otherwise too great richness of
the dark gold and blue.&nbsp; These are only a few of the
attractions of one of the finest, though not largest, cases in
the section.&nbsp; Messrs. Pellatt exhibit some Coalport ware,
which is in every respect worthy of the high repute of that
renowned manufactory.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="page2_8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span><span
class="smcap">Dr. Cranage&rsquo;s</span> undeviating aim is to
train the boys committed to his care, not only in mental
acquisitions, but in their whole moral and physical being;
believing, that as much pains and unremitting attention are
required for the latter as the former.&nbsp; Attention is given
not only to the studies which the boys pursue, but to their
recreation, games, and amusements&mdash;upon the principle that
almost every incident affords materials for improvement, and
opportunities for the formation of good habits.</p>
<p>His main object in the intellectual culture is to teach the
boy to think; without omitting the positive work and hard study
to brace &ldquo;the nerves of the mind&rdquo; for the making of a
scholar.</p>
<p>The system of rewards and punishments is peculiar, with the
general absence of corporal punishment; but the experience of
more than twenty-four years has fully proved its efficiency.</p>
<p>Above all, his desire is to bring them to Christ as their
Saviour, and then to help them to walk like Christ, as their
example.</p>
<p>Dr. Cranage finds the most wonderful difference in the
progress and conduct of the boys committed to his care according
to the measure of moral support he receives from the parents and
guardians of the boys.&nbsp; He earnestly solicits their hearty
and constant co-operation in his anxious labours.</p>
<p>The skeleton Report will give a succinct view of the subjects
of study.&nbsp; The aim is to give a thoroughly liberal
education, without too exclusive attention to Latin and
Greek.&nbsp; In the study of languages the system of Arnold is
considered admirable, but not perfect; the grammar is therefore
supplied, and iteration and reiteration of declensions,
conjugations, and rules to impress indelibly, by rote even, all
the fundamentals are resorted to.&nbsp; Latin, as the basis of
most of the modern European languages, is considered&mdash;even
to boys not going to college&mdash;very important; it is deemed
also very desirable for <i>all</i> boys to be able to read the
Greek Testament before leaving school.</p>
<p>Some objects are taught by familiar Lectures only, illustrated
by extensive apparatus; while many other subjects are
occasionally thus exemplified.</p>
<p>A report of each boy&rsquo;s improvement and conduct is sent
to his parents or guardians eight times in each year.</p>
<p>At the end of each year the School is examined by the
authority and direction of the Syndicate appointed by the
University of Cambridge, and a copy of the Report is sent to the
parents or guardians of each boy.&nbsp; There is also an
examination at midsummer by the masters of the school on the work
of the previous half-year; a report of which is sent to the
parents.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s Reading Room is furnished with good
Periodicals and a well-selected Library.</p>
<p>There is a well-furnished Laboratory for the study of
Chemistry, Photography, &amp;c.; Dr. Cranage himself instructing
in science in the school.</p>
<p>A Museum is established for collecting specimens to illustrate
natural history, arts, and sciences, together with articles of
virt&ucirc; and antiquity&mdash;the boys themselves being the
principal collectors and contributors.</p>
<p>There are three orders of distinction in the school conferred
for proficiency, combined with good conduct:&mdash;1st, Holder of
a Certificate; 2nd, Palmer, or Holder of the Palm; 3rd, or
highest, Grecian.</p>
<p>The School-house is delightfully situated within a mile of the
railway-station of Wellington; it is well adapted for its
purpose, and fitted up with the necessary appliances.&nbsp; The
school-room, reading-room, dining-room, lavatory, bath-room, and
dormitories are spacious, airy, and convenient; the playgrounds
very extensive, and well fitted for healthy recreation.</p>
<p>There is a swimming-bath on the grounds.</p>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
